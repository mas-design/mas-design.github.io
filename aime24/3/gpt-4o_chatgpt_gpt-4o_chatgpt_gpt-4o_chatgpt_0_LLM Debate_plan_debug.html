    <pre>Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

### thinking by Debate Agent Sy6x:
To find the number of intersections, we need to solve the system of equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Both functions f and g are piecewise linear, with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. The function f(x) has a V-shape with a vertex at 1/2, and g(x) has a V-shape with a vertex at 1/4. The range of f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) is from 0 to 1, and thus g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) range from 0 to 0.25. Multiplying by 4, the range of 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is from 0 to 1. The intersections occur when y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) are equal, which implies sin(2πx) = cos(3πy). The periods of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are 1 and 2/3, respectively. Solving sin(2πx) = cos(3πy) involves finding angles where 2πx equals either π/2 + 3πy + 2kπ or -π/2 - 3πy + 2kπ for integer k. Solving these equations for x and y and considering the periodicity gives us 6 intersection points.

To find the number of intersections, we need to solve the system of equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Both f(x) and g(x) are piecewise linear functions. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| ranges from 0 to 0.5, and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| ranges from 0 to 0.25. Therefore, g(f(x)) ranges from 0 to 0.25, and 4g(f(x)) ranges from 0 to 1. The periodicity of sin(2πx) is 1, and that of cos(3πy) is 2/3. The intersections occur where 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). This requires sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) to have the same effect on the functions, leading to sin(2πx) = cos(3πy). Solving this within one period, we find 6 intersections.
