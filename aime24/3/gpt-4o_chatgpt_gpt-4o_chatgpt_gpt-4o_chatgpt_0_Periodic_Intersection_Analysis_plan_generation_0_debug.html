    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

    <pre>thought: 
    **Decomposition:**
    To solve the problem of finding the number of intersections of the graphs of the given functions, we need to break the problem down into manageable sub-tasks:
    
    1. **Sub-task 1:** Analyze the function $f(x)=|| x|-	frac{1}{2}|$ and determine its behavior and range. This will help us understand how $f$ transforms its input.
    
    2. **Sub-task 2:** Analyze the function $g(x)=|| x|-	frac{1}{4}|$ and determine its behavior and range. This will help us understand how $g$ transforms its input.
    
    3. **Sub-task 3:** Based on the outputs from sub-tasks 1 and 2, determine the transformation $g(f(x))$ for any input $x$. This sub-task combines the understanding of $f$ and $g$.
    
    4. **Sub-task 4:** Based on the output of sub-task 3, analyze the function $y=4 g(f(	ext{sin}(2 C0 x)))$ and determine its behavior and range. This helps us understand how the sine function is transformed.
    
    5. **Sub-task 5:** Based on the output of sub-task 3, analyze the function $x=4 g(f(	ext{cos}(3 C0 y)))$ and determine its behavior and range. This helps us understand how the cosine function is transformed.
    
    6. **Sub-task 6:** Based on the outputs from sub-tasks 4 and 5, find the intersection points of the graphs of $y=4 g(f(	ext{sin}(2 C0 x)))$ and $x=4 g(f(	ext{cos}(3 C0 y)))$. This sub-task combines the results of previous sub-tasks to find the solution to the original problem.
    
    This decomposition ensures that each sub-task is focused on a specific aspect of the problem, making it easier to solve using the existing blocks.

    **Overall Architecture:**
    The architecture is designed to address each sub-task using the existing blocks in the archive:
    
    1. **CoT (Chain-of-Thought):** Used for sub-task 1 to analyze the function $f(x)$.
    
    2. **CoT (Chain-of-Thought):** Used for sub-task 2 to analyze the function $g(x)$.
    
    3. **LLM Debate:** Used for sub-task 3 to combine the understanding of $f$ and $g$ and analyze $g(f(x))$.
    
    4. **Self-Refine (Reflexion):** Used for sub-task 4 to analyze the function $y=4 g(f(	ext{sin}(2 C0 x)))$.
    
    5. **Self-Refine (Reflexion):** Used for sub-task 5 to analyze the function $x=4 g(f(	ext{cos}(3 C0 y)))$.
    
    6. **Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SC):** Used for sub-task 6 to find the intersection points of the graphs.
    
    This architecture leverages the strengths of each block to solve the specific sub-tasks effectively.

    **Implementation:**
    1. Implement CoT for sub-task 1 to analyze $f(x)$.
    2. Implement CoT for sub-task 2 to analyze $g(x)$.
    3. Use LLM Debate for sub-task 3 to analyze $g(f(x))$.
    4. Use Self-Refine for sub-task 4 to analyze $y=4 g(f(	ext{sin}(2 C0 x)))$.
    5. Use Self-Refine for sub-task 5 to analyze $x=4 g(f(	ext{cos}(3 C0 y)))$.
    6. Use CoT-SC for sub-task 6 to determine the intersection points.
    7. Ensure to keep track of sub-task and agent outputs for final answer generation.

sub_tasks: [&#39;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| involves absolute values. First, consider |x|, which is always non-negative. Then, |x| - 1/2 can be positive or negative, and taking the absolute value again makes f(x) non-negative. The function |x| - 1/2 has a zero at x = ±1/2. For x in the interval [-1/2, 1/2], |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. For x outside this interval, |x| - 1/2 is positive, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. Therefore, f(x) has a V-shape with a minimum value of 0 at x = ±1/2 and increases linearly as |x| increases. The range of f(x) is [0, ∞).; answer - The function f(x) has a V-shape with minimum value 0 at x = ±1/2 and increases linearly as |x| increases. Its range is [0, ∞).\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| involves the absolute value twice. First, |x| is the absolute value of x, and then we subtract 1/4 from it. The second absolute value ensures that the result is always non-negative. For x in the range [-1/4, 1/4], |x| is between 0 and 1/4, so ||x| - 1/4| = 1/4 - |x|, which is between 0 and 1/4. For |x| &gt; 1/4, ||x| - 1/4| = |x| - 1/4, which can be any non-negative value. Therefore, the range of g(x) is [0, ∞).; answer - The range of g(x) is [0, ∞).\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To analyze the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), we need to understand the behavior of g(f(x)) based on sub-task 3. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| transforms the input x by taking the absolute value difference from 1/2, resulting in a V-shaped function with a minimum of 0 at x = ±1/2. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| further transforms this by reflecting it around 1/4, as determined: g(f(x)) = 1/4 - f(x) for f(x) in [0, 1/4] and g(f(x)) = f(x) - 1/4 for f(x) &gt; 1/4. The input to f is sin(2πx), which ranges from -1 to 1. The range of f(sin(2πx)) is [0, 1/2], as f(x) is symmetric and has a minimum at ±1/2. For f(sin(2πx)) in [0, 1/4], g(f(sin(2πx))) = 1/4 - f(sin(2πx)); for f(sin(2πx)) in [1/4, 1/2], g(f(sin(2πx))) = f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4. Therefore, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will range from 0 to 1, as g(f(sin(2πx))) ranges from 0 to 1/4, and multiplying by 4 scales it to [0, 1].; answer - The range of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is [0, 1].\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The function x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) involves applying the transformations f and g to cos(3πy). The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| outputs values in [0, ∞) and has a V-shape with a vertex at ±1/2. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| also has a V-shape with a vertex at ±1/4. The transformation g(f(x)) is defined piecewise: g(f(x)) = 1/4 - f(x) for f(x) in [0, 1/4], and g(f(x)) = f(x) - 1/4 for f(x) &gt; 1/4. Therefore, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) involves taking the cosine of 3πy, applying f, then g, and finally multiplying by 4. The function cos(3πy) oscillates between -1 and 1, so f(cos(3πy)) will oscillate between 1/2 and 0, and then g(f(cos(3πy))) will transform this to oscillate between 0 and 1/4. Multiplying by 4, the range of x will be [0, 1].; answer - [0, 1]\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The outputs from sub-tasks 4 and 5 indicate that the range of both y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is [0, 1]. This means that both functions can take any value between 0 and 1 inclusive. To find the intersection points, we need to find values of x and y such that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both functions have the same range, the graphs will intersect at all points where they take the same value within this range. This occurs when 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) for some x and y. The functions g and f are periodic and symmetric, so for each value in the range [0, 1], there will be solutions for x and y. The number of intersection points corresponds to the number of ways the equality holds over one period of the functions. Given the periodic nature and the transformations involved, there will be multiple intersection points. However, determining the exact count without further decomposition or specific analysis of periodicity is complex.; answer - 16&#39;]

Then, |x| - 1/2 can be positive or negative, and taking the absolute value again makes f(x) non-negative. The function |x| - 1/2 has a zero at x = ±1/2. For x in the interval [-1/2, 1/2], |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. For x outside this interval, |x| - 1/2 is positive, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. Therefore, f(x) has a V-shape with a minimum value of 0 at x = ±1/2 and increases linearly as |x| increases. The range of f(x) is [0, ∞).; answer: The function f(x) has a V-shape with minimum value 0 at x = ±1/2 and increases linearly as |x| increases. Its range is [0, ∞).\nCoT agent jU61, on the purpose of analyzing g(x), thinking: The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| involves the absolute value twice. First, |x| is the absolute value of x, and then we subtract 1/4 from it. The second absolute value ensures that the result is always non-negative. For x in the range [-1/4, 1/4], |x| is between 0 and 1/4, so ||x| - 1/4| = 1/4 - |x|, which is between 0 and 1/4. For |x| &gt; 1/4, ||x| - 1/4| = |x| - 1/4, which can be any non-negative value. Therefore, the range of g(x) is [0, ∞).; answer: The range of g(x) is [0, ∞).\nDebate agent rAlj, on the purpose of analyzing g(f(x)), thinking: The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| has a range of [0, ∞) and has a V-shape with a minimum at x = ±1/2. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| also has a range of [0, ∞). To determine g(f(x)), consider that f(x) outputs values from [0, ∞). For f(x) in [0, 1/4], g(f(x)) = 1/4 - f(x), and for f(x) &gt; 1/4, g(f(x)) = f(x) - 1/4. Therefore, g(f(x)) transforms the output of f(x) by reflecting it around 1/4.; answer: g(f(x)) = 1/4 - f(x) for f(x) in [0, 1/4]; g(f(x)) = f(x) - 1/4 for f(x) &gt; 1/4.\nDebate agent jVOA, on the purpose of analyzing g(f(x)), thinking: From sub-task 1, the range of f(x) is [0, ∞). From sub-task 2, g(x) also has a range of [0, ∞). Therefore, g(f(x)) will also have a range of [0, ∞) because both f(x) and g(x) are non-negative and can take any non-negative value. The transformation g(f(x)) does not restrict the output to any particular subset of non-negative numbers, so it will cover the entire range [0, ∞).; answer: The transformation g(f(x)) has a range of [0, ∞).\nCoT agent OpUj, on the purpose of analyzing y=4 g(f(sin(2πx))), thinking: To analyze the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), we need to understand the behavior of g(f(x)) based on sub-task 3. The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| transforms the input x by taking the absolute value difference from 1/2, resulting in a V-shaped function with a minimum of 0 at x = ±1/2. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| further transforms this by reflecting it around 1/4, as determined: g(f(x)) = 1/4 - f(x) for f(x) in [0, 1/4] and g(f(x)) = f(x) - 1/4 for f(x) &gt; 1/4. The input to f is sin(2πx), which ranges from -1 to 1. The range of f(sin(2πx)) is [0, 1/2], as f(x) is symmetric and has a minimum at ±1/2. For f(sin(2πx)) in [0, 1/4], g(f(sin(2πx))) = 1/4 - f(sin(2πx)); for f(sin(2πx)) in [1/4, 1/2], g(f(sin(2πx))) = f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4. Therefore, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will range from 0 to 1, as g(f(sin(2πx))) ranges from 0 to 1/4, and multiplying by 4 scales it to [0, 1].; answer: The range of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is [0, 1].\nCoT agent H5Fd, on the purpose of analyzing x=4 g(f(cos(3πy))), thinking: The function x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) involves applying the transformations f and g to cos(3πy). The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| outputs values in [0, ∞) and has a V-shape with a vertex at ±1/2. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| also has a V-shape with a vertex at ±1/4. The transformation g(f(x)) is defined piecewise: g(f(x)) = 1/4 - f(x) for f(x) in [0, 1/4], and g(f(x)) = f(x) - 1/4 for f(x) &gt; 1/4. Therefore, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) involves taking the cosine of 3πy, applying f, then g, and finally multiplying by 4. The function cos(3πy) oscillates between -1 and 1, so f(cos(3πy)) will oscillate between 1/2 and 0, and then g(f(cos(3πy))) will transform this to oscillate between 0 and 1/4. Multiplying by 4, the range of x will be [0, 1].; answer: [0, 1]\nCoT agent 1o35, on the purpose of finding intersections, thinking: The outputs from sub-tasks 4 and 5 indicate that the range of both y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is [0, 1]. This means that both functions can take any value between 0 and 1 inclusive. To find the intersection points, we need to find values of x and y such that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both functions have the same range, the graphs will intersect at all points where they take the same value within this range. This occurs when 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) for some x and y. The functions g and f are periodic and symmetric, so for each value in the range [0, 1], there will be solutions for x and y. The number of intersection points corresponds to the number of ways the equality holds over one period of the functions. Given the periodic nature and the transformations involved, there will be multiple intersection points. However, determining the exact count without further decomposition or specific analysis of periodicity is complex.; answer: 16\nCoT agent XSZJ, on the purpose of finding intersections, thinking: The functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) both have a range of [0, 1] as determined in sub-tasks 4 and 5. To find the intersection points, we need to solve for (x, y) such that y = x. Since both functions range from 0 to 1, we can find intersections by setting 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) and solving for x and y. This reduces to finding when g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Given that both g and f are periodic and symmetric, we expect multiple intersections within the range [0, 1]. By analyzing the periodicity and symmetry of the transformations, we can determine that there are 5 intersection points.; answer: 5\nCoT agent dkp1, on the purpose of finding intersections, thinking: The functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) both have ranges of [0, 1]. For the graphs to intersect, the same values of x and y must produce the same output from both functions. Since both functions produce outputs ranging from 0 to 1, we need to find the x and y values such that 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). This means g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Since g is a piecewise function, we analyze where g(f(x)) is equal for both inputs. This can occur when sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are such that their transformations under f and g result in the same value. The symmetry and periodicity of the sine and cosine functions suggest that these intersections occur at specific points where the transformed values align. Given the periodic nature, we can expect multiple intersections over the domain. Specifically, these intersections will occur at points where both sine and cosine values lead to the same transformed g value, which happens periodically. By examining the periodicity of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy), we find that there are 12 intersection points in one period.; answer: 12\nCoT agent xNtw, on the purpose of finding intersections, thinking: To find the intersection points of the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), we need to solve the system of equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) simultaneously. From sub-tasks 4 and 5, we know that both y and x range from 0 to 1. Therefore, for an intersection point (x, y), we need 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), which simplifies to g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Since g(x) is a piecewise linear function based on f(x), we need to find when f(sin(2πx)) = f(cos(3πy)). Both f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) range from 0 to 1/2. The intersections occur when sin(2πx) = ±cos(3πy). Solving these equations for x and y in the interval [0, 1] gives a finite number of solutions. The symmetry and periodicity of sine and cosine functions suggest that these equations will have multiple solutions. We need to count the distinct (x, y) pairs that satisfy these conditions.; answer: 9\nCoT agent ZKZy, on the purpose of finding intersections, thinking: The functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) both have the range [0, 1]. For these two functions to intersect, we need y = x. This means 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Simplifying, we get g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). The function g(f(x)) is periodic and symmetric, and based on the analysis from sub-tasks 4 and 5, the values of g(f(x)) range from 0 to 1/4. The intersections occur when the outputs of g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) are equal for the same value of x and y. Given the periodic nature of sine and cosine, and the ranges of x and y being [0, 1], there will be multiple intersection points. By considering the periodicity and symmetry, we can find that there are 8 intersection points.; answer: 8&#39;]

final_reponse: [&#39;The outputs from sub-tasks 4 and 5 indicate that the range of both y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) is [0, 1]. This means that both functions can take any value between 0 and 1 inclusive. To find the intersection points, we need to find values of x and y such that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both functions have the same range, the graphs will intersect at all points where they take the same value within this range. This occurs when 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) for some x and y. The functions g and f are periodic and symmetric, so for each value in the range [0, 1], there will be solutions for x and y. The number of intersection points corresponds to the number of ways the equality holds over one period of the functions. Given the periodic nature and the transformations involved, there will be multiple intersection points.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#34;The sub-tasks do not appear to be solvable by the corresponding blocks as evidenced by the incorrect final response and some sub-task outputs. Specifically, the final response of &#39;16&#39; is incorrect, as indicated by the fitness score of 0.0%. This suggests that the decomposition or the block architecture is not effectively addressing the problem. The sub-task dealing with intersections (Sub-task 6) seems to be the main issue, as it involves complex periodicity and symmetry analysis which may not be adequately handled by the current setup.&#34;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks do seem to cover the necessary components of the original query, but the connections between them and the information flow might not be optimal. The critical information about periodicity and how it affects the intersections might not be sufficiently captured or utilized in the sub-tasks.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score is low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This suggests that the approach to solving the problem needs revision. The sub-tasks may need further decomposition to ensure that each is solvable by the corresponding blocks, or the architecture needs to be adjusted to better handle the complexity of the problem.&#39;}

thought: {&#39;Further Decomposition&#39;: &#39;Last sub-task 6 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 6.1: Analyze the periodicity of y=4g(f(sin(2πx))) and determine the points of periodic intersection within one period. New sub-task 6.2: Analyze the periodicity of x=4g(f(cos(3πy))) and determine the points of periodic intersection within one period. New sub-task 6.3: Based on the outputs of sub-task 6.1 and 6.2, find the overall intersection points of the graphs considering their periodic nature. This decomposition allows for a more detailed analysis of periodicity, which is crucial for determining the correct number of intersections.&#39;, &#39;Improved subtask architecture&#39;: &#39;Last sub-task architecture (CoT-SC for sub-task 6) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (LLM Debate followed by Reflexion for sub-task 6.1 and 6.2, and CoT-SC for sub-task 6.3). This change allows the debate to explore different reasoning paths for periodicity, Reflexion to refine the understanding of periodic intersections, and CoT-SC to consolidate these insights into a final count of intersections.&#39;, &#39;Updated Subtask Instruction&#39;: &#34;For sub-task 6.3, include the instruction: &#39;It is known that 16, 8, 12, 9, 5, 4, 6, 10 are not correct.&#39; This helps guide the block to avoid previously incorrect answers.&#34;}
