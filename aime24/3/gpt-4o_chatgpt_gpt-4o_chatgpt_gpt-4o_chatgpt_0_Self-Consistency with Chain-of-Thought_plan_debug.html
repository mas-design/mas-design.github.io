    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to analyze the functions and find the intersections of the graphs.

1. Analyze $f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}|$: This function takes the absolute value of $x$, subtracts 1/2, and then takes the absolute value again. It has a V-shape with vertex at $x = \pm 1/2$, and is symmetric about $x = 0$.

2. Analyze $g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}|$: This function is similar to $f(x)$ but with 1/4 instead of 1/2. It has a V-shape with vertex at $x = \pm 1/4$.

3. Consider $f(\sin(2\pi x))$: Since $\sin(2\pi x)$ ranges from -1 to 1, $|\sin(2\pi x)|$ ranges from 0 to 1. Therefore, $f(\sin(2\pi x)) = ||\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2}|$ will range from 0 to 1/2.

4. Consider $g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))$: Since $f(\sin(2\pi x))$ ranges from 0 to 1/2, $g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = ||f(\sin(2\pi x))| - \frac{1}{4}|$ will range from 0 to 1/4.

5. The function $y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))$ will have a range from 0 to 1.

6. Similarly, analyze $f(\cos(3\pi y))$: Since $\cos(3\pi y)$ ranges from -1 to 1, $|\cos(3\pi y)|$ ranges from 0 to 1. Therefore, $f(\cos(3\pi y))$ will also range from 0 to 1/2.

7. Similarly, $g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))$ will range from 0 to 1/4.

8. The function $x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))$ will also have a range from 0 to 1.

9. The graphs $y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))$ and $x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))$ both have ranges from 0 to 1.

10. The intersections occur when $4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))$, which simplifies to $g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))$.

11. Since both $g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))$ and $g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))$ range from 0 to 1/4, and are periodic with period 1 for $x$ and $y$ respectively, we need to count the number of solutions over the interval $[0, 1]$ for $x$ and $y$.

12. The function $g(f(\sin(2\pi x)))$ has a piecewise linear form with changes at points corresponding to $\sin(2\pi x) = \pm 1/2$. Similarly, $g(f(\cos(3\pi y)))$ changes at points where $\cos(3\pi y) = \pm 1/2$.

13. The key points for intersections occur when these values are equal, which happens at specific $x$ and $y$ values due to symmetry and periodicity.

14. By analyzing the symmetry and periodicity, we find that there are 8 such intersection points in the interval $[0, 1] \times [0, 1]$.
