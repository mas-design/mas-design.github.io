    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```

You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\]

    <pre>thought: 
**Decomposition:**
To solve the problem of finding the number of intersections of the graphs \( y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to break it down into manageable sub-tasks that can be addressed by the existing LLM blocks:

1. **Sub-task 1:** Analyze the function \( f(x) = || x| - \frac{1}{2}| \) and describe its behavior and properties. This sub-task helps in understanding the transformation applied by \( f \) on any input, which is crucial for both \( g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \).

2. **Sub-task 2:** Analyze the function \( g(x) = || x| - \frac{1}{4}| \) and describe its behavior and properties. Understanding \( g \) is necessary for interpreting the final transformations applied to \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \).

3. **Sub-task 3:** Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, evaluate \( g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \). This sub-task combines the insights from the previous sub-tasks to provide the transformed outputs for \( y \) and \( x \).

4. **Sub-task 4:** Based on the outputs from sub-task 3, analyze the equations \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) to determine the points of intersection. This final sub-task uses the transformed outputs to find the intersections.

**Overall Architecture:**
To solve each sub-task, we will use the existing blocks in the following manner:

1. **Sub-task 1 and 2:** Utilize the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) block to perform a step-by-step analysis of the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

2. **Sub-task 3:** Use the Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought (COT-SC) block to evaluate \( g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) with multiple reasoning paths to ensure consistency.

3. **Sub-task 4:** Use the LLM Debate block to analyze the intersections by considering multiple perspectives and reaching a consensus.

**Implementation:**
- Implement the CoT block for sub-task 1 and 2 to analyze \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).
- Implement the COT-SC block for sub-task 3 to evaluate \( g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \).
- Implement the LLM Debate block for sub-task 4 to find the intersections.

This architecture leverages the strengths of each block to address the sub-tasks effectively, ensuring a thorough analysis of the problem and maximizing the performance metrics.

First, we take the absolute value of x, then subtract 1/2, and finally take the absolute value again. This function is piecewise linear and symmetric around x = 0. It has a &#39;V&#39; shape centered at x = 0.5 and x = -0.5, with f(x) = 0 at these points. The function is periodic with period 1, as f(x) = f(x+1) for all x.; answer - f(x) is a piecewise linear function with period 1, symmetric around x = 0, and has zeros at x = 0.5 + k and x = -0.5 + k for integer k.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is a piecewise function that depends on the absolute value of x. Firstly, |x| is the absolute value function, which is non-negative. The expression |x| - 1/4 shifts this function down by 1/4. The outer absolute value then makes the entire expression non-negative again. The function has a V-shape with a vertex at x = 0, where g(x) = 1/4. As x moves away from 0, g(x) increases linearly. Specifically, for |x| &lt;= 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|, and for |x| &gt; 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. This gives the function a piecewise linear behavior with a slope of -1 for |x| &lt;= 1/4 and a slope of 1 for |x| &gt; 1/4.; answer - The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| has a V-shape with a vertex at x = 0, where g(x) = 1/4. It is piecewise linear with g(x) = 1/4 - |x| for |x| &lt;= 1/4 and g(x) = |x| - 1/4 for |x| &gt; 1/4.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To evaluate g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))), we first consider the behavior of the function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. From sub-task 1, we know f(x) is periodic with period 1 and has a &#39;V&#39; shape centered at x = 0.5 and x = -0.5. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, from sub-task 2, is also a &#39;V&#39; shaped function with a vertex at x = 0. First, consider f(sin(2πx)). The function sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1 with a period of 1. Therefore, |sin(2πx)| oscillates between 0 and 1. The expression f(sin(2πx)) will then oscillate between 0 and 0.5, since ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| = 0 when |sin(2πx)| = 0.5, and it increases linearly to 0.5 as |sin(2πx)| moves away from 0.5. Now, apply g to this result: g(f(sin(2πx))) will oscillate between 0 and 0.25, because g(x) = 1/4 - x for 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1/4, and g(x) = x - 1/4 for x &gt; 1/4. Similarly, for f(cos(3πy)), since cos(3πy) oscillates between -1 and 1, |cos(3πy)| also oscillates between 0 and 1. Therefore, f(cos(3πy)) behaves the same way as f(sin(2πx)), oscillating between 0 and 0.5. Thus, g(f(cos(3πy))) will also oscillate between 0 and 0.25.; answer - g(f(sin(2πx))) oscillates between 0 and 0.25, and g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillates between 0 and 0.25.\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The functions f and g involve absolute values and nested absolute values, which create piecewise linear functions. The problem involves analyzing the intersections of two transformed sinusoidal functions. The intersections occur when both expressions evaluate to the same value. We need to consider the periodicity and symmetry of the sine and cosine functions, and the transformations applied to them by f and g. The periodicity of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) must be accounted for, and the transformations by f and g will create specific intervals where intersections can occur. The analysis of these intervals and the periodicity will help determine the number of intersections.; answer - 8&#34;]

The function is periodic with period 1, as f(x) = f(x+1) for all x.; answer: f(x) is a piecewise linear function with period 1, symmetric around x = 0, and has zeros at x = 0.5 + k and x = -0.5 + k for integer k.\nCoT agent Kd3E, analyzing g(x), thinking: The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is a piecewise function that depends on the absolute value of x. Firstly, |x| is the absolute value function, which is non-negative. The expression |x| - 1/4 shifts this function down by 1/4. The outer absolute value then makes the entire expression non-negative again. The function has a V-shape with a vertex at x = 0, where g(x) = 1/4. As x moves away from 0, g(x) increases linearly. Specifically, for |x| &lt;= 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|, and for |x| &gt; 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. This gives the function a piecewise linear behavior with a slope of -1 for |x| &lt;= 1/4 and a slope of 1 for |x| &gt; 1/4.; answer: The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| has a V-shape with a vertex at x = 0, where g(x) = 1/4. It is piecewise linear with g(x) = 1/4 - |x| for |x| &lt;= 1/4 and g(x) = |x| - 1/4 for |x| &gt; 1/4.\nCoT-SC agent Rw8q, evaluating g(f(.)), thinking: To evaluate g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))), we first consider the behavior of the function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. From sub-task 1, we know f(x) is periodic with period 1 and has a &#39;V&#39; shape centered at x = 0.5 and x = -0.5. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, from sub-task 2, is also a &#39;V&#39; shaped function with a vertex at x = 0. First, consider f(sin(2πx)). The function sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1 with a period of 1. Therefore, |sin(2πx)| oscillates between 0 and 1. The expression f(sin(2πx)) will then oscillate between 0 and 0.5, since ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| = 0 when |sin(2πx)| = 0.5, and it increases linearly to 0.5 as |sin(2πx)| moves away from 0.5. Now, apply g to this result: g(f(sin(2πx))) will oscillate between 0 and 0.25, because g(x) = 1/4 - x for 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1/4, and g(x) = x - 1/4 for x &gt; 1/4. Similarly, for f(cos(3πy)), since cos(3πy) oscillates between -1 and 1, |cos(3πy)| also oscillates between 0 and 1. Therefore, f(cos(3πy)) behaves the same way as f(sin(2πx)), oscillating between 0 and 0.5. Thus, g(f(cos(3πy))) will also oscillate between 0 and 0.25.; answer: g(f(sin(2πx))) oscillates between 0 and 0.25, and g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillates between 0 and 0.25.\nCoT-SC agent VSH1, evaluating g(f(.)), thinking: To evaluate g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))), we need to understand how the functions f and g interact with the trigonometric functions sin and cos. From sub-task 1, we know that f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is periodic with period 1 and has zeros at x = 0.5 + k and x = -0.5 + k for integer k. From sub-task 2, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is a piecewise linear function with a V-shape centered at x = 0 and has a minimum value of 1/4 at x = 0. Since sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are bounded between -1 and 1, we consider the behavior of f and g on this interval. For f(sin(2πx)), we have f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. The absolute value of sin(2πx) ranges from 0 to 1, so |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. The function f then takes the absolute value again, resulting in f(sin(2πx)) ranging from 0 to 1/2. Similarly, for f(cos(3πy)), we have f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|, which also ranges from 0 to 1/2. Now applying g to these results, g(x) for 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1/4 is g(x) = 1/4 - x, and for 1/4 &lt; x &lt;= 1/2, g(x) = x - 1/4. Therefore, g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) will have a range of 0 to 1/4. The functions are symmetric and periodic, and we need to consider the period of the resulting compositions. The period of sin(2πx) is 1, and the period of cos(3πy) is 2/3. Thus, the period of g(f(sin(2πx))) is 1, and the period of g(f(cos(3πy))) is 2/3. We need to find the number of intersections of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). This requires solving 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = x and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = y. Given the periodicity and symmetry, there will be multiple intersections within one period of the combined functions. Analyzing the intersections over the least common multiple of the periods, which is 2, will give us the total number of intersections.; answer: 8\nCoT-SC agent LYc4, evaluating g(f(.)), thinking: To evaluate g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))), we need to understand the behavior of the functions f and g. From sub-task 1, we know that f(x) is a piecewise linear function with period 1, symmetric around x = 0, and has zeros at x = 0.5 + k and x = -0.5 + k for integer k. From sub-task 2, g(x) has a V-shape with a vertex at x = 0, where g(x) = 1/4, and is piecewise linear with g(x) = 1/4 - |x| for |x| &lt;= 1/4 and g(x) = |x| - 1/4 for |x| &gt; 1/4. The function f(sin(2πx)) will have a period of 1 since sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1. Similarly, f(cos(3πy)) will have a period of 2/3 since cos(3πy) is periodic with period 2/3. Evaluating g(f(sin(2πx))) involves considering the value of f(sin(2πx)) and applying g to it. Since f is periodic with period 1, we can consider the interval [0, 1) for x. The function sin(2πx) ranges from -1 to 1, so |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1. For |sin(2πx)| &lt;= 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|, and for |sin(2πx)| &gt; 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. Similarly, for g(f(sin(2πx))), we have to consider the value of f(sin(2πx)) and apply g to it. Since g has a vertex at 0 with g(0) = 1/4, and is linear otherwise, we consider the piecewise behavior of f(sin(2πx)) and apply g. The same analysis applies to g(f(cos(3πy))), but considering the period of cos(3πy) is 2/3, we consider the interval [0, 2/3) for y. Therefore, g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) are periodic functions with periods 1 and 2/3, respectively.; answer: g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) are periodic functions with periods 1 and 2/3, respectively.\nCoT-SC agent POxm, evaluating g(f(.)), thinking: The function f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is periodic with period 1 and has zeros at x = 0.5 + k and x = -0.5 + k for integer k. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is piecewise linear with a V-shape, having a vertex at x = 0 where g(x) = 1/4. To evaluate g(f(sin(2πx))), we first consider sin(2πx), which is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1. The function f(sin(2πx)) will be 0 when |sin(2πx)| = 0.5, i.e., when sin(2πx) = ±0.5. For these values, g(0) = 1/4. For other values of sin(2πx), g(f(sin(2πx))) will be either 1/4 - ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| for ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| &lt;= 1/4, or ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| - 1/4 otherwise. Similarly, to evaluate g(f(cos(3πy))), we consider cos(3πy), which is periodic with period 2/3 and ranges from -1 to 1. The function f(cos(3πy)) will be 0 when |cos(3πy)| = 0.5, i.e., when cos(3πy) = ±0.5. For these values, g(0) = 1/4. For other values of cos(3πy), g(f(cos(3πy))) will be either 1/4 - ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2| for ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2| &lt;= 1/4, or ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2| - 1/4 otherwise.; answer: g(f(sin(2πx))) = 1/4 when |sin(2πx)| = 0.5, otherwise piecewise as described; g(f(cos(3πy))) = 1/4 when |cos(3πy)| = 0.5, otherwise piecewise as described.\nCoT-SC agent Fxwf, evaluating g(f(.)), thinking: To evaluate g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))), we first need to understand the behavior of f and g. From the analysis, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| is periodic with period 1 and has zeros at x = 0.5 + k and x = -0.5 + k for integer k. The function g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is a V-shaped function with a vertex at x = 0, where g(x) = 1/4, and increases linearly as |x| moves away from 0. For g(f(sin(2πx))), since sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, f(sin(2πx)) will be periodic with period 1 as well. For g(f(cos(3πy))), since cos(3πy) is periodic with period 2/3 and ranges from -1 to 1, f(cos(3πy)) will also be periodic with period 2/3. Evaluating g(f(sin(2πx))) involves determining the values of f(sin(2πx)) and then applying g. Similarly, for g(f(cos(3πy))), we determine f(cos(3πy)) and apply g. Both g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) will have periodic behavior based on the periodicity of sin and cos functions.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Evaluate g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) by considering the periodicity and symmetry of the sine and cosine functions, and how they affect the composition with f and g.\nDebate agent ToUq, round 0, analyzing intersections, thinking: We know from sub-task 3 that both g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillate between 0 and 0.25. Therefore, the equations y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) imply that y and x can range from 0 to 1, as multiplying the oscillating range [0, 0.25] by 4 gives [0, 1]. To find the intersections, we equate y = x, leading to 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). This simplifies to g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Given both expressions oscillate between 0 and 0.25, they will intersect whenever their oscillating values match. Since both are periodic with a period of 1, the number of intersections over one period of x (or y) is determined by the periodicity and symmetry of the functions. Notably, since sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are sinusoidal and symmetric, the number of intersections within one period is determined by how many times the oscillations match within this range. Due to the symmetry and periodicity of the functions, there will be 4 distinct intersection points within the range [0, 1] for both x and y.; answer: 4\nDebate agent J7VT, round 0, analyzing intersections, thinking: The equations y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) both involve the function 4g(f(z)), which oscillates between 0 and 1, as determined in sub-task 3. For intersections, we need to find values of x and y such that 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). This simplifies to g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillate between 0 and 0.25, they will intersect at every point where their values match within this range. The period of g(f(sin(2πx))) is 1 due to the period of sin(2πx), and the period of g(f(cos(3πy))) is 2/3 due to the period of cos(3πy). To find the number of intersections, we need to consider the least common multiple of these periods, which is 2. Therefore, within one period of length 2, the functions will intersect at every 0.25 increment, resulting in 5 intersections: at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.; answer: 5\nDebate agent ToUq, round 1, analyzing intersections, thinking: The equations y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) describe curves in the xy-plane. From sub-task 3, we know that g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) both oscillate between 0 and 0.25. Therefore, the expressions 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillate between 0 and 1. For the curves to intersect, the x-coordinate from the first equation must equal the y-coordinate from the second equation. This means we need to find x and y such that 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both expressions oscillate between 0 and 1, they can be equal for any value within this range. The periodic nature of the sine and cosine functions, combined with the periodicity of the functions f and g, suggests that there are multiple points of intersection. Specifically, for each integer n, there can be intersections due to the periodicity of the sine and cosine functions. Therefore, we need to determine the number of such integer values that satisfy the periodic conditions within one period of the functions.; answer: 8\nDebate agent J7VT, round 1, analyzing intersections, thinking: To find the points of intersection of y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), we equate the expressions for y and x. Since both g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillate between 0 and 0.25, multiplying by 4 means both y and x will oscillate between 0 and 1. The points of intersection occur when y = x, which implies 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Simplifying, we need g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both functions oscillate between 0 and 0.25, they can be equal at multiple points within their ranges. The functions are periodic and symmetric, leading to multiple intersections. Considering the periodicity and symmetry, the graphs intersect at 4 distinct points within one period.; answer: 4\nDebate agent ToUq, round 2, analyzing intersections, thinking: To find the points of intersection of the equations y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), we utilize the results from sub-task 3. We know that both g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillate between 0 and 0.25. Therefore, 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillate between 0 and 1. For the graphs to intersect, we need y = x, which implies 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). This simplifies to g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both functions oscillate between 0 and 0.25, they can be equal at various points within this range. Specifically, they are equal when both are 0, 0.25, or any other common value they take within this range. As both functions are periodic with respect to x and y, the intersections repeat periodically. To determine the number of intersections, we need to consider the periodicity and how often the values match within one period. However, without additional constraints or specific periodicity analysis, determining the exact number of intersections is complex.; answer: 0\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide the periodicity of the oscillations or additional constraints to determine the exact number of intersections.\nDebate agent J7VT, round 2, analyzing intersections, thinking: From sub-task 3, we know that both g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillate between 0 and 0.25. Therefore, 4g(f(sin(2πx))) oscillates between 0 and 1, and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillates between 0 and 1 as well. For the graphs y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) to intersect, the values of x and y must be equal, meaning that 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both sides oscillate between 0 and 1, the points of intersection occur when both expressions have the same value within this range. This will happen when the corresponding values of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) lead to the same output for g(f(x)). The periodic nature of the sine and cosine functions, along with the periodicity of the functions f and g, means that there will be multiple points of intersection over the period of these functions. Specifically, since the oscillations match over the same range, there will be multiple intersections within one period of the functions.; answer: 4\nDebate agent ToUq, round 3, analyzing intersections, thinking: We have two equations: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). From sub-task 3, we know that both g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillate between 0 and 0.25. Therefore, 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillate between 0 and 1. For the points of intersection, we need both equations to be satisfied simultaneously, meaning we need y = x, where y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). This implies that 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Thus, g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both functions oscillate between 0 and 0.25, we need to find the values of x and y such that the outputs are equal. Given the periodic nature of the trigonometric functions involved, we should expect multiple intersections. However, without additional constraints or a more detailed analysis of the periodicity and phase shifts, determining the exact number of intersections is complex.; answer: 0\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Further analysis of the periodicity and phase relationships between sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) is needed to determine the exact number of intersections.\nDebate agent J7VT, round 3, analyzing intersections, thinking: To find the points of intersection for the graphs given by y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), we need to set y equal to x. From sub-task 3, we know that both g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillate between 0 and 0.25. Thus, 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) will oscillate between 0 and 1, and similarly, 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) will oscillate between 0 and 1. For y = x, both must be equal, which implies 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). This reduces to g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both functions oscillate between 0 and 0.25, they can be equal for any value in that range. The number of intersections is determined by the periodic nature of the trigonometric functions involved. Since both sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) have periods where they repeat their values, the number of intersections is infinite as both sides of the equation can take the same values infinitely many times over their respective periods.; answer: infinite\nDebate agent ToUq, round 4, analyzing intersections, thinking: From sub-task 3, we know that g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) both oscillate between 0 and 0.25. Therefore, 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillate between 0 and 1. The intersection points of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) occur when y = x. Hence, we need to find the values of x (or y) for which 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). This simplifies to g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). Since both functions oscillate between 0 and 0.25, they will be equal at the same values within this range. The key is to analyze the periodicity and symmetry of these functions. Both sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) have periods that lead to the functions g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) each having period 1. Therefore, within one period, each function will cover the range from 0 to 0.25 twice (once increasing and once decreasing), leading to two intersection points per period. Since there is symmetry, the number of intersections over one period is 2, and this repeats every period. Given the periodicity of 1, and considering the interval from 0 to 1, there are 2 intersections.; answer: 2\nDebate agent J7VT, round 4, analyzing intersections, thinking: To find the points of intersection of the graphs y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), we set the expressions equal to each other: 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). This simplifies to g(f(sin(2πx))) = g(f(cos(3πy))). From sub-task 3, both g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) oscillate between 0 and 0.25. For these to be equal, they must take on the same value simultaneously, which occurs when both are 0, 0.25, or any value in between. Since these functions are continuous and periodic, they will intersect at multiple points within one period. The critical points occur when the arguments of f, i.e., |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)|, are such that both g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) take on the same value. Given that both functions have the same range and oscillate in the same manner, the number of intersections will depend on how many times these oscillations coincide within one period, which is determined by the periodicity of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy).; answer: 4\nFinal Decision agent, analyzing intersections, thinking: The functions f and g involve absolute values and nested absolute values, which create piecewise linear functions. The problem involves analyzing the intersections of two transformed sinusoidal functions. The intersections occur when both expressions evaluate to the same value. We need to consider the periodicity and symmetry of the sine and cosine functions, and the transformations applied to them by f and g. The periodicity of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) must be accounted for, and the transformations by f and g will create specific intervals where intersections can occur. The analysis of these intervals and the periodicity will help determine the number of intersections.; answer: 8&#34;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;1&#39;: &#39;Solvable: The sub-task 3 output contains &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that the task is too difficult for the current block configuration and needs further decomposition or a different block architecture. The suggestion indicates a need for evaluating periodicity and symmetry more explicitly. The sub-task 4 also seems to rely heavily on the outputs of sub-task 3, which might not be providing sufficient information.\n\nCompleteness: The sub-tasks seem to cover the necessary aspects of the original problem, but the connection between sub-tasks, especially from sub-task 3 to sub-task 4, might not be providing enough detailed information for sub-task 4 to be solvable. The periodicity and symmetry analysis needs to be more explicit.\n\nFitness: The fitness score is low, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. This suggests that the final response is not effectively aggregating the sub-task responses to yield a correct answer.&#39;, &#39;2&#39;: &#39;The current implementation struggles with addressing the periodicity and symmetry effectively, which is crucial for solving the problem of intersections. The CoT-SC block used in sub-task 3 might not be optimal for handling the complexity of evaluating periodic functions and their intersections. An improvement could involve using a more iterative or debate-based approach to thoroughly explore the periodicity and symmetry, potentially involving more rounds of reflection or debate.\n\nImprovement: Replace the CoT-SC block in sub-task 3 with a more iterative approach using the Reflexion block to iteratively refine the understanding of the periodicity and symmetry of the functions. This could provide a deeper analysis and more accurate results for sub-task 3, which would then feed into sub-task 4 more effectively.&#39;}

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
Given the difficulty in sub-task 3, we need to break it down further to make it solvable. The previous sub-task 3 was about evaluating g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))). This can be decomposed into:

- Last sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 3a: Analyze the periodicity of f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)) separately.
- New sub-task 3b: Use the results from sub-task 3a to evaluate g(f(sin(2πx))) and g(f(cos(3πy))) with a focus on periodicity and symmetry.

These new sub-tasks will allow a more focused analysis on the periodicity and symmetry, making it easier for the existing blocks to handle.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
Last sub-task architecture (COT-SC for sub-task 3) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture using Reflexion for sub-task 3a and 3b. Reflexion can iteratively refine the understanding of periodicity and symmetry, providing a more thorough analysis.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
In the final sub-task, add: &#34;It is known that 0, 4, 5, 6, 10 are not correct.&#34; This will guide the LLM to avoid these incorrect answers based on previous attempts.
