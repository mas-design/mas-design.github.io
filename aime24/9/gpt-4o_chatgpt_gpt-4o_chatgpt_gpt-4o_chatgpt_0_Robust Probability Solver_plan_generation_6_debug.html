    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

    <pre>thought: 
    **Decomposition:**
    To solve the given problem, we can break it down into the following sub-tasks:
    
    - **Sub-task 1:** Calculate the total number of ways Jen can pick 4 numbers from the set S.
    - **Sub-task 2:** Determine the number of ways to pick 4 numbers from S such that at least 2 of them match with Jen&#39;s chosen numbers.
    - **Sub-task 3:** Calculate the probability of winning a prize (at least 2 matches) by dividing the number of ways to win a prize by the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers.
    - **Sub-task 4:** Calculate the number of ways to pick 4 numbers from S such that all 4 of them match with Jen&#39;s chosen numbers.
    - **Sub-task 5:** Calculate the probability of winning the grand prize (all 4 matches) by dividing the number of ways to win the grand prize by the number of ways to win a prize.
    - **Sub-task 6:** Find m and n such that the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize was won is m/n, and then compute m+n.
    
    This decomposition ensures that each sub-task is manageable and can be solved using the existing blocks in the archive. The sub-tasks are designed to progressively build up to the final solution by first understanding the combinatorial aspects of the problem and then calculating the required probabilities.

    **Overall Architecture:**
    To address each sub-task, I propose the following architecture using the existing blocks:
    
    - **Sub-task 1:** Use the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) block to calculate the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from S.
    - **Sub-task 2:** Use the Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SC) block to determine the number of ways to pick 4 numbers with at least 2 matches.
    - **Sub-task 3:** Use the Reflexion block to calculate the probability of winning a prize.
    - **Sub-task 4:** Use the LLM Debate block to calculate the number of ways to pick 4 numbers with all matches.
    - **Sub-task 5:** Use the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) block to calculate the probability of winning the grand prize.
    - **Sub-task 6:** Use the Reflexion block to find m and n and compute m+n.

    **Implementation:**
    The architecture is implemented as follows:
    
    - **Layer 1:**
        - CoT for Sub-task 1
        - CoT-SC for Sub-task 2
    - **Layer 2:**
        - Reflexion for Sub-task 3 (based on outputs from Sub-task 1 and 2)
        - LLM Debate for Sub-task 4
    - **Layer 3:**
        - CoT for Sub-task 5 (based on outputs from Sub-task 3 and 4)
        - Reflexion for Sub-task 6 (based on outputs from Sub-task 5)

    The architecture leverages the strengths of each block to handle specific aspects of the problem, ensuring a comprehensive approach to solving the original question.
    

debug_thought: The error &#39;too many values to unpack (expected 2)&#39; suggests that I attempted to unpack a return value that contains more than two elements. The issue likely arises from the use of LLMAgentBase, which returns multiple Info objects that I tried to unpack into just two variables (thinking and answer). To fix this, I need to ensure that I correctly handle all returned Info objects, possibly by adjusting the unpacking or inspecting the returned list to correctly assign values.

This is given by the binomial coefficient C(10, 4).; answer - 210\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To solve this, we need to consider the number of ways to select 4 numbers from S such that at least 2 of them match with Jen&#39;s chosen numbers. Let&#39;s denote Jen&#39;s chosen numbers as a set J with 4 elements. The number of ways to select 4 numbers from S is 210 (since \\( \\binom{10}{4} = 210 \\)). We need to count the cases where at least 2 numbers from J appear in the chosen set. This can be done by considering the cases where exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers from J appear in the chosen set. For exactly 2 matches, choose 2 numbers from J (\\( \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\)) and 2 numbers from S \\ J (\\( \\binom{6}{2} = 15 \\)), giving 90 ways. For exactly 3 matches, choose 3 numbers from J (\\( \\binom{4}{3} = 4 \\)) and 1 number from S \\ J (\\( \\binom{6}{1} = 6 \\)), giving 24 ways. For exactly 4 matches, there is only 1 way (\\( \\binom{4}{4} = 1 \\)). Adding these gives 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 ways.; answer - 115\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The probability of winning a prize is calculated by finding the number of favorable outcomes where at least two of Jen&#39;s numbers match the drawn numbers. From previous calculations, there are 115 such favorable outcomes. The total number of ways to draw 4 numbers from the set of 10 is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, which is 115/210. This simplifies to 23/42. This calculation correctly considers the cases of matching exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers.; answer - 23/42\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Jen has already selected her 4 numbers, and for her to win the grand prize, the 4 numbers drawn must exactly match her selection.

From sub-task 4, there is 1 way to win the grand prize. From sub-task 3, there are 115 ways to win a prize. Therefore, the probability is 1/115. We need to express this probability as a fraction in simplest form to find m and n.; answer - 1/115\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize is calculated as 1/115, based on the number of ways to win the grand prize and the number of ways to win any prize.

First, compute the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S, which is C(10, 4). Then, we consider the scenarios where the number of matches is 2, 3, or 4.

We need to calculate the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S such that at least 2 of them match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers. Jen picks 4 numbers from S, and we denote these numbers as J. We can calculate the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S such that exactly 2, 3, or 4 of them are in J. We use the binomial coefficient to count these possibilities. For exactly 2 matches, we choose 2 numbers from J and 2 numbers from S \\ J. For exactly 3 matches, we choose 3 numbers from J and 1 number from S \\ J. For exactly 4 matches, all 4 numbers are from J.

To win a prize, at least 2 of Jen&#39;s numbers must match the randomly chosen numbers. We need to find the number of ways to pick 4 numbers from S such that at least 2 of them match with Jen&#39;s chosen numbers. We can use the complementary counting principle. First, we find the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S, which is C(10, 4). Then, we calculate the number of ways where fewer than 2 of Jen&#39;s numbers match the chosen numbers. If 0 of Jen&#39;s numbers match, all 4 numbers are chosen from the 6 numbers not picked by Jen, which is C(6, 4). If 1 of Jen&#39;s numbers matches, we choose 1 number from her 4 and 3 from the remaining 6, which is C(4, 1) * C(6, 3). Subtract these from the total to find the number of ways at least 2 match.; answer: 185\nCoT agent O6Rm, on the purpose of calculating prize probability, thinking: The probability of winning a prize (at least 2 matches) is the number of favorable outcomes (115 ways) divided by the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set (210 ways).; answer: 115/210\nCritic agent gjHV, on the purpose of reviewing probability calculation, thinking: The probability calculation provided is incorrect because it suggests that the probability of winning a prize is simply the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total outcomes. However, this does not take into account the condition that Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. The calculation should consider the different cases: matching exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers and sum those probabilities.; answer: The correct probability of winning a prize should be calculated by considering the cases where Jen matches exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers. We need to find the probabilities for each case and sum them to get the total probability of winning a prize.\nCoT agent O6Rm, on the purpose of refining prize probability, thinking: The probability of winning a prize should consider the cases where Jen matches at least 2 numbers. We already calculated the number of ways to pick 4 numbers with at least 2 matches as 115. The probability of winning a prize is indeed the ratio of favorable outcomes (115) to total outcomes (210), which simplifies to 23/42.; answer: 23/42\nCritic agent gjHV, on the purpose of reviewing probability calculation, thinking: The probability calculation seems to be incorrect in the context of the original problem. The number of ways to win a prize should include all cases where at least two of Jen&#39;s numbers match the drawn numbers, but the calculation provided (115 ways) might not account for all such cases correctly. The total number of ways to draw 4 numbers from 10 is 210, so the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by 210. However, the given probability of 23/42 simplifies to 115/210, which implies that the calculation might have been misinterpreted or miscalculated. The correct probability of winning a prize should be verified by ensuring all cases with at least two matches are considered.; answer: The probability of winning a prize should be recalculated by ensuring all cases where at least two numbers match are included. The calculation of 23/42 seems to be based on a specific interpretation that might have missed some cases. A recomputation or verification is needed to ensure accuracy.\nCoT agent O6Rm, on the purpose of refining prize probability, thinking: The probability of winning a prize is calculated by considering the number of favorable outcomes where at least two of Jen&#39;s numbers match the drawn numbers.

This calculation correctly considers the cases of matching exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers.; answer: 23/42\nCritic agent gjHV, on the purpose of reviewing probability calculation, thinking: The calculation seems correct, but let&#39;s review it. The probability of winning a prize is found by considering the cases where Jen matches at least 2 numbers out of 4 drawn. The total ways to draw 4 numbers from 10 is indeed 210. The favorable outcomes include matching exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers. The number of ways to match exactly 2 numbers is C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90. The number of ways to match exactly 3 numbers is C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24. The number of ways to match exactly 4 numbers is C(4,4) = 1. Adding these gives 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 favorable outcomes. Thus, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;(1)&#39;: &#34;Upon reviewing the proposed architecture and sub-tasks, it&#39;s clear that while the decomposition is generally sound, there are issues with the solvability of some sub-tasks. Specifically, Sub-task 2 (determining the number of ways to pick 4 numbers with at least 2 matches) seems to have inconsistent results, as evidenced by the varying answers from the CoT-SC agents. This suggests that the task may still be too complex for the block, indicating a need for further decomposition (case (a)). Additionally, the probability calculations in Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 5 may benefit from more precise guidance to improve accuracy. The fitness score remains at 0.0%, indicating that the final response is incorrect.&#34;, &#39;(2)&#39;: &#34;The implementation could be improved by ensuring that each sub-task is sufficiently decomposed and that the instructions are clear and precise. For Sub-task 2, further decomposing the task into smaller, more manageable parts could help. For Sub-task 3 and Sub-task 5, refining the instructions to include specific steps and ensuring that all necessary information from previous sub-tasks is included could lead to a more accurate final answer. Additionally, incorporating feedback from the &#39;memory&#39; entry to avoid known incorrect answers in the final sub-task could improve the final response.&#34;}

thought: To address the identified issues, I propose the following revisions:

(1) **Further Decomposition**:

- Last Sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 2.1: Calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 2 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 2 that don&#39;t.
- New Sub-task 2.2: Calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 3 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 1 that doesn&#39;t.
- New Sub-task 2.3: Calculate the number of ways to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers.

This further decomposition ensures that each sub-task is more focused and manageable, allowing for more precise calculations. It also provides a clearer path to the final answer by explicitly addressing each possible case of matching numbers.

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**:

For Sub-task 6, the instruction should include: &#34;It is known that 116 is not correct.&#34; This will help guide the architecture to avoid this incorrect final answer and encourage exploration of alternative solutions.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To calculate the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}, we use the combination formula C(n, k), which represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without regard to order. In this case, n = 10 and k = 4.; answer - 210\nSub-task 2.1 output: thinking - Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S. To win a prize, at least 2 of her numbers must match the randomly chosen numbers. We want to calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 2 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 2 numbers that do not. First, we choose 2 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 chosen numbers, which can be done in C(4, 2) ways. Then, we choose 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in the set S that are not chosen by Jen, which can be done in C(6, 2) ways. We multiply these two results to find the total number of ways.; answer - 90\nSub-task 2.2 output: thinking - To calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 3 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 1 that doesn&#39;t, we must first consider the number of ways Jen can choose her 4 numbers from the set S. There are C(10, 4) ways for Jen to choose her numbers, but we are interested in a specific case where 3 of the numbers match. We choose 3 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers, which can be done in C(4, 3) ways. Then, we choose 1 number from the remaining 6 numbers (those not chosen by Jen) in C(6, 1) ways. Thus, the total number of ways to pick exactly 3 matching numbers is C(4, 3) * C(6, 1).; answer - 24\nSub-task 2.3 output: thinking - To calculate the number of ways to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, we note that if Jen has chosen 4 specific numbers, there is exactly 1 way for the randomly chosen 4 numbers to match all of Jen&#39;s numbers. This is because Jen&#39;s numbers must be exactly the same as the randomly chosen numbers for her to win the grand prize.; answer - 1\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The task is to refine the probability calculation for winning a prize, which involves determining the number of favorable outcomes where Jen wins a prize and dividing it by the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set S. The favorable outcomes include cases where Jen matches exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers with the randomly chosen numbers, totaling 115 ways. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is 210. The probability is 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 5. This simplification is correct.; answer - 23/42\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Jen&#39;s chosen 4 distinct numbers must exactly match the randomly chosen set of 4 numbers. Since Jen&#39;s set is fixed and we are choosing 4 numbers from S that must match exactly with Jen&#39;s, there is only 1 way for this to happen.; answer - 1\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To find the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen won a prize, we use conditional probability. From sub-task 3, we know the probability of winning a prize is 23/42. From sub-task 4, we know there is 1 way to win the grand prize (all 4 numbers match). The probability of winning the grand prize is the number of ways to win the grand prize divided by the number of ways to win a prize. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given she won a prize is (1/115) / (23/42) = 42/115. Since 42 and 115 are relatively prime, the answer is 42/115, and m+n is 42+115.; answer - 157\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The problem involves calculating the conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won. The probability of winning the grand prize is given as 1/115, and the probability of winning any prize is given as 23/42. The conditional probability is calculated as (1/115) / (23/42), which simplifies to 42/115. Since 42 and 115 are relatively prime, the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, m = 42 and n = 115, leading to m+n = 42+115.; answer - 157&#34;]

(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) Solvable: Upon reviewing the sub-tasks and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the architecture is not yielding the correct final answer, as indicated by the fitness score of 0.0%. The sub-tasks seem to be generally well-defined, but the issue lies in the calculation of probabilities and the simplification process, particularly in Sub-task 6 where the final answer is incorrect. The error in the final response suggests that there might be a misunderstanding or miscalculation in determining the conditional probability or simplifying the fraction.

Completeness: The sub-tasks appear to cover all necessary aspects of the problem, including calculating the number of ways to match numbers and determining probabilities. However, there might be a need for clearer connections between sub-tasks to ensure that all critical information is effectively utilized in subsequent calculations.

Fitness: The fitness score remains at 0.0%, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This suggests that while the sub-tasks are conceptually complete, the implementation or calculation within the sub-tasks needs refinement.

(2) Implementation Improvements: To improve the final answer, the implementation should ensure that the calculation of probabilities is accurate and that fractions are simplified correctly. It might be beneficial to explicitly include checks or guidance for simplifying fractions correctly and ensuring that all calculations are consistent with the problem&#39;s requirements. Additionally, incorporating feedback from the &#39;memory&#39; entry to avoid known incorrect answers in the final sub-task could improve the final response.

thought: To address the identified issues, I propose the following revisions:

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**:

For Sub-task 6, the instruction should include: &#34;It is known that 116 and 157 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the architecture to avoid these incorrect final answers and encourage exploration of alternative solutions.

Additionally, ensure that the calculation of probabilities is accurate and that fractions are simplified correctly. Implement checks or guidance for simplifying fractions correctly within the sub-tasks.

Here, n = 10 and k = 4.; answer - 210\nSub-task 2.1 output: thinking - Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from S. To calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 2 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 2 that don&#39;t, we first choose 2 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers and then choose 2 numbers from the 6 remaining numbers in S that Jen did not choose. The number of ways to choose 2 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers is C(4, 2). The number of ways to choose 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers is C(6, 2). Therefore, the total number of ways is C(4, 2) * C(6, 2).; answer - 90\nSub-task 2.2 output: thinking - Jen picks 4 numbers, and we need exactly 3 of them to match the 4 randomly chosen numbers. We can choose 3 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers in C(4, 3) ways, which is 4 ways. The remaining 1 number must be from the 6 numbers in the set S that Jen did not choose. We can choose this 1 number in C(6, 1) ways, which is 6 ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to pick exactly 3 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 1 that doesn&#39;t is 4 * 6.; answer - 24\nSub-task 2.3 output: thinking - For Jen to win the grand prize, all 4 numbers she picks must match the 4 numbers randomly chosen. There is exactly 1 way to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, as there is only one set of 4 numbers that are exactly the same as the ones Jen picked.; answer - 1\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The probability of winning a prize involves calculating the number of successful outcomes where Jen matches at least 2 of her numbers with the randomly chosen ones. From the sub-tasks, we have: 90 ways to match exactly 2 numbers, 24 ways to match exactly 3 numbers, and 1 way to match all 4 numbers, totaling 115 successful outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5, resulting in 23/42.; answer - 23/42\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, and we need to find the number of ways to pick 4 numbers from S such that all 4 match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers. Since the randomly chosen numbers must be identical to Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, there is only 1 way to achieve this, as it involves selecting the exact same set of 4 numbers that Jen picked.; answer - 1\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To find the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize, we need to consider the number of ways to win the grand prize and the number of ways to win any prize. From sub-task 4, there is 1 way to win the grand prize. From sub-task 3, there are 115 ways to win any prize. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize is the ratio of these two numbers: 1/115. This fraction is already in its simplest form.; answer - 1/115\nSub-task 6 output: thinking - The previous attempts to calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize were incorrect because the sum m+n=116 was deemed incorrect. This suggests an error in counting the number of ways to win any prize or the grand prize. Jen must match at least 2 numbers to win a prize, and all 4 to win the grand prize. To refine the calculation, we need to correctly determine these counts. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \\(\\binom{10}{4} = 210\\). The number of ways to win at least 2 numbers involves complex counting, potentially including cases where she matches exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers. The number of ways to win the grand prize is straightforwardly 1, as she must match all 4 numbers. Re-evaluating these counts requires a detailed combinatorial analysis which is not fully provided here. Without this reevaluation, the exact probability and thus m+n cannot be accurately determined.; answer - 116\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the number of ways to win any prize and the number of ways to win the grand prize to ensure the probability calculation is correct, as 116 is known to be incorrect.&#34;]

The number of ways to choose 2 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers is C(4, 2). The number of ways to choose 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers is C(6, 2).

We can choose this 1 number in C(6, 1) ways, which is 6 ways.

There is exactly 1 way to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, as there is only one set of 4 numbers that are exactly the same as the ones Jen picked.; answer: 1\nCoT agent wgkR, on the purpose of calculating prize probability, thinking: To find the probability of winning a prize (at least 2 matches), we need to calculate the number of successful outcomes and divide by the total number of possible outcomes. The successful outcomes include cases where Jen matches exactly 2, 3, or all 4 numbers. From sub-task 2.1, the number of ways to match exactly 2 numbers is 90. From sub-task 2.2, the number of ways to match exactly 3 numbers is 24. From sub-task 2.3, the number of ways to match all 4 numbers is 1. Therefore, the total number of successful outcomes is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The total number of possible outcomes is given by sub-task 1, which is 210. The probability of winning a prize is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 115/210.; answer: 115/210\nCritic agent WYbV, on the purpose of reviewing probability calculation, thinking: The probability calculation here is correct. The total number of successful outcomes where Jen wins a prize is 115, and the total number of possible outcomes is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210. This matches the calculation provided.; answer: Yes, the probability calculation provided is correct.\nCoT agent wgkR, on the purpose of refining prize probability, thinking: The probability calculation for winning a prize involves finding the number of successful outcomes where Jen matches at least 2 of her numbers with the randomly chosen ones. The number of successful outcomes is the sum of the ways to match exactly 2 numbers (90 ways), exactly 3 numbers (24 ways), and all 4 numbers (1 way), totaling 115 successful outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5, resulting in 23/42. Thus, the refined probability of winning a prize is 23/42.; answer: 23/42\nCritic agent WYbV, on the purpose of reviewing probability calculation, thinking: The probability calculation for winning a prize seems accurate based on the given information. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is indeed 210. The breakdown of successful outcomes into cases where Jen matches exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers seems consistent with standard combinatorial methods. Simplifying 115/210 to 23/42 is correct as well.; answer: The refined probability of winning a prize is correctly calculated as 23/42.\nCoT agent wgkR, on the purpose of refining prize probability, thinking: To refine the probability calculation for winning a prize, we need to ensure the successful outcomes are correctly counted and the probability is expressed in simplest terms. The successful outcomes occur when Jen matches exactly 2, 3, or all 4 numbers. From the sub-tasks, we have: 90 ways to match exactly 2 numbers, 24 ways to match exactly 3 numbers, and 1 way to match all 4 numbers. Thus, there are 115 successful outcomes. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210. Simplifying this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5, we get 23/42. This is the refined probability of winning a prize.; answer: 23/42\nCritic agent WYbV, on the purpose of reviewing probability calculation, thinking: The probability calculation for winning a prize was correctly refined by considering the number of successful outcomes (matching exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers) and simplifying the fraction.

From sub-task 4, there is 1 way to win the grand prize. From sub-task 3, there are 115 ways to win any prize. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize is the ratio of these two numbers: 1/115. This fraction is already in its simplest form.; answer: 1/115\nCoT agent P85r, on the purpose of finding m and n, thinking: From sub-task 5, we have the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize is 1/115. This means m = 1 and n = 115, as the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115.; answer: 116\nCritic agent d6q8, on the purpose of reviewing m and n calculation, thinking: The calculation of m and n seems to have an error. The probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize should be calculated based on the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes that result in winning a prize. If the probability is 1/115, then m = 1 and n = 115, resulting in m + n = 116. However, since 116 was previously stated to be incorrect, there might be a mistake in the computation of the probability or the interpretation of m and n.; answer: The correct calculation needs to be verified, as 116 was stated to be incorrect. There might be an error in the probability calculation or the interpretation of m and n.\nCoT agent P85r, on the purpose of refining m and n calculation, thinking: The previous calculation stated that the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize is 1/115, which implies m = 1 and n = 115, leading to m + n = 116. However, since 116 was stated to be incorrect, there must be an error in the calculation or interpretation. To refine this, we need to ensure that the probability calculation is correct. The probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is the number of ways to win the grand prize divided by the number of ways to win any prize. If these numbers were miscalculated, the fraction 1/115 could be incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the number of ways to win any prize and the number of ways to win the grand prize to ensure the probability is correct.; answer: 116\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the number of ways to win any prize and the number of ways to win the grand prize to ensure the probability calculation is correct, as 116 is known to be incorrect.\nCritic agent d6q8, on the purpose of reviewing m and n calculation, thinking: The calculation of m and n seems to be incorrect based on the final answer given as 116, which was stated to be incorrect. The problem likely lies in the probability calculation of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won. This probability is the ratio of the number of ways to win the grand prize to the number of ways to win any prize. The initial calculation of 1/115 needs to be re-evaluated, as it was derived from an incorrect interpretation or computation.; answer: 116\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the number of ways to win any prize and the number of ways to win the grand prize to ensure the probability calculation is correct, as 116 is known to be incorrect.\nCoT agent P85r, on the purpose of refining m and n calculation, thinking: The task is to find the values of m and n such that the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize is m/n, and then compute m+n. The previous attempts concluded that the probability is 1/115, leading to m = 1 and n = 115, thus m+n = 116. However, 116 was stated to be incorrect, suggesting an error in the probability calculation. The probability of winning the grand prize given a prize should be the number of ways to win the grand prize divided by the number of ways to win any prize. This requires accurate counts of both scenarios, which might have been miscalculated. Without reevaluating or recalculating these counts, it&#39;s challenging to correct the probability and subsequently m and n.; answer: 116\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the number of ways to win any prize and the number of ways to win the grand prize to ensure the probability calculation is correct, as 116 is known to be incorrect.\nCritic agent d6q8, on the purpose of reviewing m and n calculation, thinking: The previous calculation of m+n as 116 was incorrect, indicating a mistake in the probability computation. The task requires determining the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won, which involves accurately counting the number of favorable outcomes for both winning any prize and winning the grand prize. The discrepancy suggests that these counts were not computed correctly, leading to the incorrect probability and thus the wrong m and n.; answer: 116\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the number of ways to win any prize and the number of ways to win the grand prize to ensure the probability calculation is correct, as 116 is known to be incorrect.\nCoT agent P85r, on the purpose of refining m and n calculation, thinking: The previous attempts to calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given winning any prize were incorrect because the final answer of 116 was stated to be wrong.

Initially, the probability was calculated as 1/115, but the sum m+n=116 was deemed incorrect. This suggests an error in counting the number of ways to win any prize or the grand prize. To refine the calculation, we need to correctly determine these counts. Jen must match at least 2 numbers to win a prize, and all 4 to win the grand prize. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \\(\\binom{10}{4} = 210\\). The number of ways to win at least 2 numbers involves complex counting, potentially including cases where she matches exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) Solvable: The sub-tasks are not fully solvable as evidenced by the inclusion of &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; in the final sub-task. This indicates that the task decomposition is still too complex for the blocks to handle effectively. In particular, Sub-task 6 is problematic, as it fails to calculate the correct probability due to incorrect or incomplete counting of ways to win any prize or the grand prize. This suggests a need for further decomposition or a different approach to ensure accurate probability calculations.

Completeness: While the sub-tasks attempt to cover all necessary aspects of the problem, the critical information needed for calculating the correct probability is not fully captured or utilized in the sub-tasks, leading to an incorrect final result. The connection between sub-tasks needs to be strengthened to ensure all relevant information is effectively used in subsequent calculations.

Fitness: The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This highlights the need for improved task decomposition or architecture to achieve a correct and comprehensive solution.

(2) Implementation Improvements: To improve the final answer, the implementation should include a more detailed and accurate breakdown of the number of ways to win any prize and the grand prize. This might involve further decomposing the sub-tasks or using a different block architecture to ensure all relevant combinations and probabilities are correctly calculated. Additionally, explicitly avoiding known incorrect answers in the final sub-task can guide the architecture towards a correct solution.

thought: To address the identified issues, I propose the following revisions:

(1) **Further Decomposition**:

- Last Sub-task 6 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 6.1: Re-evaluate the number of ways to win any prize by considering all possible combinations where Jen matches at least 2 numbers.
- New Sub-task 6.2: Re-evaluate the number of ways to win the grand prize by ensuring all 4 numbers match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers.
- New Sub-task 6.3: Calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize using the results from 6.1 and 6.2, and ensure that the final result avoids known incorrect answers (116 and 157).

This further decomposition ensures that each sub-task is more focused and manageable, allowing for more precise calculations. It also provides a clearer path to the final answer by explicitly addressing each possible case of matching numbers.

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**:

For Sub-task 6.3, the instruction should include: &#34;It is known that 116 and 157 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the architecture to avoid these incorrect final answers and encourage exploration of alternative solutions.

Here, n = 10 and k = 4.; answer - 210\nSub-task 2.1 output: thinking - Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from S. To win a prize, at least two of her numbers must match the randomly chosen numbers. We need to find the number of ways to pick exactly 2 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 2 that don&#39;t. First, choose 2 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 chosen numbers, which can be done in C(4, 2) ways. Then, choose 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in S that are not in Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, which can be done in C(6, 2) ways. Multiply these two results to get the total number of ways.; answer - 90\nSub-task 2.2 output: thinking - Jen picks 4 numbers from the set S. To calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 3 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 1 that doesn&#39;t, we need to consider the following: First, choose 3 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 chosen numbers. There are C(4, 3) ways to do this. Then, choose 1 number from the remaining 6 numbers that were not picked by Jen. There are C(6, 1) ways to do this.

Since there is only one specific set of 4 numbers that she can choose that will match the randomly chosen numbers, there is exactly 1 way to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers.; answer - 1\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The probability of winning a prize involves calculating the number of ways Jen can win at least 2 matches out of the total possible outcomes. From sub-task 1, the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from S is 210. From sub-tasks 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, the number of successful outcomes is 115 (90 ways for exactly 2 matches, 24 ways for exactly 3 matches, and 1 way for exactly 4 matches). Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42.; answer - 23/42\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - To win the grand prize, the 4 randomly chosen numbers must exactly match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers. Since Jen has already picked a specific set of 4 numbers, there is only one way to choose the same set of 4 numbers from her chosen numbers.; answer - 1\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is the ratio of the number of ways to win the grand prize to the number of ways to win any prize. From sub-task 3, the number of ways to win a prize is 115, and from sub-task 4, the number of ways to win the grand prize is 1. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is 1/115.; answer - 1/115\nSub-task 6.1 output: thinking - To find the number of ways Jen can win any prize, we need to consider all scenarios where at least 2 of her chosen numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. This includes the cases where exactly 2, exactly 3, or all 4 of her numbers match. We already calculated these cases separately: 90 ways for exactly 2 matches, 24 ways for exactly 3 matches, and 1 way for all 4 matches. The total number of ways to win any prize is the sum of these cases.; answer - 115\nSub-task 6.2 output: thinking - To win the grand prize, Jen&#39;s 4 chosen numbers must exactly match the 4 randomly chosen numbers from the set S. There is only one specific set of 4 numbers that she can choose that will match the randomly chosen numbers, meaning there is exactly 1 way for Jen to win the grand prize if all 4 numbers match.; answer - 1\nSub-task 6.3 output: thinking - The probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize is calculated by dividing the number of ways to win the grand prize by the number of ways to win any prize. From sub-task 6.2, there is 1 way to win the grand prize. From sub-task 6.1, there are 115 ways to win any prize. Therefore, the probability is 1/115. We need to express this probability as a fraction m/n where m and n are relatively prime. Here, m = 1 and n = 115, so m+n = 1+115 = 116. However, 116 was stated as incorrect, suggesting a mistake in the previous calculations or assumptions. But given the provided information, 116 is the answer based on the calculations.; answer - 116&#34;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) Solvable: The sub-tasks are not fully solvable in their current form, as indicated by the repeated incorrect final answer of 116. The inclusion of &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; suggests that the task decomposition is not yet effective enough to tackle the complexity of the problem, particularly in Sub-task 6.3. This indicates that the task decomposition needs further refinement to ensure each sub-task is manageable and solvable by the blocks.

Completeness: Although the sub-tasks attempt to address the necessary components of the problem, they fail to connect all the critical information needed to derive the correct final answer. The sub-tasks must be more explicitly linked to ensure all relevant data is used in subsequent calculations.

Fitness: The fitness score remains at 0.0%, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This suggests that the current architecture or task decomposition does not effectively solve the problem, necessitating improvements to achieve a correct and comprehensive solution.

(2) Implementation Improvements: To improve the final answer, the implementation should include a more detailed breakdown of the number of ways to win any prize and the grand prize. This might involve further decomposing the sub-tasks or using a different block architecture to ensure all relevant combinations and probabilities are correctly calculated. Additionally, explicitly avoiding known incorrect answers in the final sub-task can guide the architecture towards a correct solution.

thought: To address the identified issues, I propose the following revisions:

(1) **Further Decomposition**:

- Last Sub-task 6.3 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 6.3.1: Verify the number of ways to win any prize by cross-checking with previous sub-tasks.
- New Sub-task 6.3.2: Verify the number of ways to win the grand prize by cross-checking with previous sub-tasks.
- New Sub-task 6.3.3: Calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize using the results from 6.3.1 and 6.3.2, and ensure that the final result avoids known incorrect answers (116 and 157).

This further decomposition ensures that each sub-task is more focused and manageable, allowing for more precise calculations. It also provides a clearer path to the final answer by explicitly addressing each possible case of matching numbers.

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**:

For Sub-task 6.3.3, the instruction should include: &#34;It is known that 116 and 157 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the architecture to avoid these incorrect final answers and encourage exploration of alternative solutions.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To calculate the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}, we use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), where n is the total number of elements in the set and k is the number of elements to choose. Here, n = 10 and k = 4. Therefore, the total number of ways is C(10, 4).; answer - 210\nSub-task 2.1 output: thinking - To solve this, we need to consider how Jen picks her numbers and how the lottery picks its numbers. Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S. To win a prize, at least 2 of her numbers must be among the 4 randomly chosen numbers. We want to find the number of ways to pick exactly 2 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 2 that don&#39;t. First, Jen picks 4 numbers from the set S, which can be done in C(10, 4) ways, but since we are only considering the case where exactly 2 match, we don&#39;t need to consider the ways Jen picks her numbers directly. Instead, we assume Jen has already picked 4 numbers. Let&#39;s say Jen&#39;s chosen numbers are a subset J of S with |J| = 4. We need to choose 2 numbers from J to match the lottery numbers. There are C(4, 2) ways to choose 2 matching numbers from J. Then, we need to choose 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in S that are not in J. There are C(6, 2) ways to do this. Therefore, the number of ways to pick exactly 2 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 2 that don&#39;t is C(4, 2) * C(6, 2).; answer - 90\nSub-task 2.2 output: thinking - Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S. To calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 3 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 1 that doesn&#39;t, we first choose 3 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers. This can be done in C(4, 3) ways. Then, we choose 1 number from the remaining numbers in S that are not among Jen&#39;s 4 numbers. There are 6 such numbers remaining in S, so we choose 1 from these 6. This can be done in C(6, 1) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is C(4, 3) * C(6, 1).; answer - 24\nSub-task 2.3 output: thinking - To calculate the number of ways to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, we need to consider that Jen has already picked her 4 distinct numbers. The only way for all 4 of her numbers to match the randomly chosen numbers is if the randomly chosen set is exactly the same as Jen&#39;s chosen set. Therefore, there is exactly 1 way to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers.; answer - 1\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The probability calculation for winning a prize has been repeatedly reviewed and verified to be correct. The number of ways to win a prize was calculated by considering the cases of exactly 2, 3, and 4 matches, which were found to be 90, 24, and 1 respectively. This gives a total of 115 ways to win a prize. The total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42. This calculation is accurate and does not require further refinement.; answer - 23/42\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Jen has already chosen her set of 4 numbers, and to match all 4 numbers with her set, there is only one specific set of 4 numbers that can match exactly. Thus, there is only one way to pick 4 numbers from S that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers.; answer - 1\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize is the ratio of the number of ways to win the grand prize to the number of ways to win a prize. From sub-task 4, there is only 1 way to win the grand prize. From sub-task 3, there are 115 ways to win a prize. Therefore, the probability is 1/115.; answer - 1/115\nSub-task 6.3.1 output: thinking - To verify the number of ways to win any prize, we consider the cases where Jen wins a prize: she has at least 2 numbers matching the randomly chosen numbers. From previous sub-tasks, we calculated the number of ways for each case: 90 ways for exactly 2 matches, 24 ways for exactly 3 matches, and 1 way for exactly 4 matches. Therefore, the total number of ways to win any prize is the sum of these cases: 90 + 24 + 1.; answer - 115\nSub-task 6.3.2 output: thinking - To verify the number of ways to win the grand prize, we need to cross-check with the previous sub-tasks. In Sub-task 2.3, we found that the number of ways to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers is 1. This is because if Jen&#39;s chosen numbers are a subset J of S with |J| = 4, the only way to win the grand prize is if the lottery numbers exactly match Jen&#39;s numbers. Therefore, there is only one way for all 4 numbers to match, which is consistent with Sub-task 2.3. Thus, the number of ways to win the grand prize is indeed 1, as previously determined.; answer - 1\nSub-task 6.3.3 output: thinking - To calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize, we use the formula for conditional probability. The probability of winning the grand prize given that she wins a prize is the number of ways to win the grand prize divided by the number of ways to win any prize. From sub-task 6.3.1, the number of ways to win any prize is 115. From sub-task 6.3.2, the number of ways to win the grand prize is 1. Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115. We need to express this probability as a fraction in simplest form. Since 1 and 115 are already relatively prime, the fraction is 1/115. Thus, m = 1 and n = 115. The problem asks for m + n, so we calculate 1 + 115.; answer - 116&#34;]

This can be done in C(4, 3) ways. Then, we choose 1 number from the remaining numbers in S that are not among Jen&#39;s 4 numbers. There are 6 such numbers remaining in S, so we choose 1 from these 6. This can be done in C(6, 1) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is C(4, 3) * C(6, 1).; answer: 24\nCoT agent rKjk, on the purpose of calculating ways with all matches, thinking: To calculate the number of ways to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, we need to consider that Jen has already picked her 4 distinct numbers.

Therefore, there is exactly 1 way to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers.; answer: 1\nCoT agent FuP8, on the purpose of calculating prize probability, thinking: To find the probability of winning a prize, we need to calculate the total number of favorable outcomes where Jen wins a prize and divide it by the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set S. From the sub-tasks, we have the number of ways to win a prize as the sum of the cases where at least 2 of Jen&#39;s numbers match: exactly 2 matches (90 ways), exactly 3 matches (24 ways), and exactly 4 matches (1 way). Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from S is 210 (sub-task 1). Thus, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210. This fraction simplifies to 23/42.; answer: 23/42\nCritic agent nwZI, on the purpose of reviewing probability calculation, thinking: The probability calculation seems correct based on the information provided.

The simplification of the fraction 115/210 to 23/42 is also correct.; answer: Yes, the calculation of the probability of winning a prize as 23/42 is correct.\nCoT agent FuP8, on the purpose of refining prize probability, thinking: The probability calculation for winning a prize was correctly determined by summing the number of ways to have at least 2 matches and dividing by the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set.

The probability of winning the grand prize given that she wins a prize is the number of ways to win the grand prize divided by the number of ways to win any prize. From sub-task 6.3.1, the number of ways to win any prize is 115. From sub-task 6.3.2, the number of ways to win the grand prize is 1. Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115. We need to express this probability as a fraction in simplest form. Since 1 and 115 are already relatively prime, the fraction is 1/115. Thus, m = 1 and n = 115. The problem asks for m + n, so we calculate 1 + 115.\n\nAnswer:116&#39;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) Solvable: The sub-tasks are not fully solvable as evidenced by the repeated incorrect final answer of 116. The current architecture struggles to correctly calculate the probability needed for Sub-task 6.3.3. This indicates a need for further decomposition or a more effective use of existing blocks to ensure each sub-task is manageable and solvable.

Completeness: The sub-tasks attempt to cover the necessary components of the problem, but they fail to integrate all critical information effectively. The connections between sub-tasks need to be strengthened to ensure all relevant data is used in subsequent calculations.

Fitness: The fitness score remains at 0.0%, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This suggests that the current architecture or task decomposition does not effectively solve the problem, necessitating improvements to achieve a correct and comprehensive solution.

(2) Implementation Improvements: To improve the final answer, the implementation should include a more detailed breakdown of the number of ways to win any prize and the grand prize. This might involve further decomposing the sub-tasks or using a different block architecture to ensure all relevant combinations and probabilities are correctly calculated. Additionally, explicitly avoiding known incorrect answers in the final sub-task can guide the architecture towards a correct solution.

thought: To address the identified issues, I propose the following revisions:

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**:

For Sub-task 6.3.3, the instruction should include: &#34;It is known that 116 and 157 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the architecture to avoid these incorrect final answers and encourage exploration of alternative solutions.

Additionally, ensure that the calculation of probabilities is accurate and that fractions are simplified correctly. Implement checks or guidance for simplifying fractions correctly within the sub-tasks.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To find the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}, we use the combination formula. The number of ways to choose 4 elements from a set of 10 elements is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of elements to choose from, and k is the number of elements to choose. Here, n = 10 and k = 4.; answer - 210\nSub-task 2.1 output: thinking - To calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 2 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 2 that don&#39;t, we first choose 2 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 chosen numbers and then choose 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in the set S that are not among Jen&#39;s chosen numbers. The number of ways to choose 2 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 chosen numbers is C(4, 2), and the number of ways to choose 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers is C(6, 2). We multiply these two results to get the total number of ways.; answer - 90\nSub-task 2.2 output: thinking - Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S. To find the number of ways to pick exactly 3 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 1 that doesn&#39;t, we first choose 3 matching numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 chosen numbers, and then 1 non-matching number from the remaining numbers in S. There are C(4, 3) ways to choose 3 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4, and C(6, 1) ways to choose 1 number from the remaining 6 numbers in S (since 4 numbers are chosen by Jen, leaving 6 numbers).; answer - 24\nSub-task 2.3 output: thinking - To calculate the number of ways to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, we consider that Jen has already picked her 4 distinct numbers from the set S. There is exactly 1 way to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, because her chosen numbers must exactly match the 4 numbers drawn in the lottery.; answer - 1\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The probability calculation for winning a prize has been reviewed and confirmed multiple times. The total number of ways to draw 4 numbers from 10 is 210, and the number of ways to win a prize (at least 2 matches) is 115. This gives a probability of 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42. Therefore, the calculation is accurate and no further refinement is needed.; answer - 23/42\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Jen picks 4 distinct numbers, and to match all 4 numbers exactly, there is only one specific way to choose them, which is by picking the exact same set of numbers that Jen picked. Therefore, there is only one way to pick 4 numbers that match all of Jen&#39;s numbers.; answer - 1\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To find the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen has won a prize, we use conditional probability. We know that the probability of winning a prize (at least 2 matches) is 23/42. The number of ways to win the grand prize (all 4 matches) is 1. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize is 1/210. The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is (1/210) / (23/42). This simplifies to (1/210) * (42/23) = 1/115. Thus, the probability is 1/115, where m = 1 and n = 115, so m+n = 116.; answer - 116\nSub-task 6.3.1 output: thinking - To verify the number of ways to win any prize, we need to consider the cases where Jen wins any prize. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. We have already calculated the number of ways for each scenario: exactly 2 matches (90 ways), exactly 3 matches (24 ways), and exactly 4 matches (1 way). To find the total number of ways to win any prize, we sum these individual cases: 90 (exactly 2 matches) + 24 (exactly 3 matches) + 1 (exactly 4 matches).; answer - 115\nSub-task 6.3.2 output: thinking - To verify the number of ways to win the grand prize, we need to ensure that the calculation of choosing all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers is consistent. According to Sub-task 2.3, there is exactly 1 way to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers because Jen&#39;s chosen numbers must exactly match the 4 numbers drawn in the lottery. This makes sense because if Jen chooses 4 numbers, and the lottery draws exactly those 4 numbers, there is only 1 way this can happen, which is by choosing all 4 of Jen&#39;s numbers. Therefore, the number of ways to win the grand prize is indeed 1, as verified by the previous sub-task.; answer - 1\nSub-task 6.3.3 output: thinking - We know from sub-task 6.3.1 that the total number of ways Jen can win any prize is 115. From sub-task 6.3.2, we know the number of ways to win the grand prize is 1. The probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize is the number of ways to win the grand prize divided by the number of ways to win any prize. Therefore, the probability is 1/115. We need to express this probability in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime. Here, m = 1 and n = 115, and they are already relatively prime. The sum m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.; answer - 116&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent JO8U, on the purpose of calculating total ways to pick 4 numbers, thinking: To find the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}, we use the combination formula. The number of ways to choose 4 elements from a set of 10 elements is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of elements to choose from, and k is the number of elements to choose. Here, n = 10 and k = 4.; answer: 210\nCoT agent JO8U, on the purpose of calculating ways with exactly 2 matches, thinking: To calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 2 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 2 that don&#39;t, we first choose 2 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 chosen numbers and then choose 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in the set S that are not among Jen&#39;s chosen numbers. The number of ways to choose 2 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 chosen numbers is C(4, 2), and the number of ways to choose 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers is C(6, 2). We multiply these two results to get the total number of ways.; answer: 90\nCoT agent JO8U, on the purpose of calculating ways with exactly 3 matches, thinking: Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S. To find the number of ways to pick exactly 3 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 1 that doesn&#39;t, we first choose 3 matching numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 chosen numbers, and then 1 non-matching number from the remaining numbers in S. There are C(4, 3) ways to choose 3 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4, and C(6, 1) ways to choose 1 number from the remaining 6 numbers in S (since 4 numbers are chosen by Jen, leaving 6 numbers).; answer: 24\nCoT agent JO8U, on the purpose of calculating ways with all matches, thinking: To calculate the number of ways to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, we consider that Jen has already picked her 4 distinct numbers from the set S. There is exactly 1 way to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, because her chosen numbers must exactly match the 4 numbers drawn in the lottery.; answer: 1\nCoT agent 6ElO, on the purpose of calculating prize probability, thinking: To calculate the probability of winning a prize (at least 2 matches), we need to find the number of favorable outcomes where Jen wins a prize and divide it by the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set S. From sub-task 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, we have the number of ways to pick exactly 2, 3, and 4 matching numbers, respectively. The total number of favorable outcomes is the sum of these: 90 (for exactly 2 matches) + 24 (for exactly 3 matches) + 1 (for exactly 4 matches) = 115. The total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from S is 210, as calculated in sub-task 1. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210.; answer: 115/210\nCritic agent bm37, on the purpose of reviewing probability calculation, thinking: The probability calculation seems correct. The total number of favorable outcomes where Jen wins a prize (at least 2 matches) is correctly summed as 115 (90 for exactly 2 matches, 24 for exactly 3 matches, and 1 for exactly 4 matches). The total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set S is correctly calculated as 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is correctly calculated as 115/210.; answer: 115/210\nCoT agent 6ElO, on the purpose of refining prize probability, thinking: The previous calculation of the probability of winning a prize was correct. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers match the drawn numbers. We found that there are 90 ways for exactly 2 matches, 24 ways for exactly 3 matches, and 1 way for exactly 4 matches, totaling 115 ways. The total number of ways to draw 4 numbers from 10 is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210. This fraction can be simplified to 23/42.; answer: 23/42\nCritic agent bm37, on the purpose of reviewing probability calculation, thinking: The calculation of the probability of winning a prize was correctly done by Chain-of-Thought Agent 6ElO. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers match the drawn numbers.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) Solvable: The sub-tasks continue to produce incorrect results, particularly in the final sub-task, as evidenced by the repeated incorrect answer of 116. This indicates that the current decomposition is not effectively solving the problem. The blocks do not seem to handle the complexity of calculating the conditional probability accurately, suggesting a need for further decomposition or a different approach.

Completeness: While the sub-tasks attempt to cover all necessary components of the problem, they fail to integrate all critical information effectively. The connections between sub-tasks need to be strengthened to ensure all relevant data is used in subsequent calculations.

Fitness: The fitness score remains at 0.0%, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This suggests that the current architecture or task decomposition does not effectively solve the problem, necessitating improvements to achieve a correct and comprehensive solution.

(2) Implementation Improvements: To improve the final answer, the implementation should include a more detailed breakdown of the number of ways to win any prize and the grand prize. This might involve further decomposing the sub-tasks or using a different block architecture to ensure all relevant combinations and probabilities are correctly calculated. Additionally, explicitly avoiding known incorrect answers in the final sub-task can guide the architecture towards a correct solution.

thought: To address the identified issues, I propose the following revisions:

(1) **Further Decomposition**:

- Last Sub-task 6.3.3 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 6.3.3.1: Re-evaluate the probability of winning a prize by considering all possible combinations where Jen matches at least 2 numbers.
- New Sub-task 6.3.3.2: Re-evaluate the probability of winning the grand prize by ensuring all 4 numbers match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers.
- New Sub-task 6.3.3.3: Calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize using the results from 6.3.3.1 and 6.3.3.2, and ensure that the final result avoids known incorrect answers (116 and 157).

This further decomposition ensures that each sub-task is more focused and manageable, allowing for more precise calculations. It also provides a clearer path to the final answer by explicitly addressing each possible case of matching numbers.

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**:

For Sub-task 6.3.3.3, the instruction should include: &#34;It is known that 116 and 157 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the architecture to avoid these incorrect final answers and encourage exploration of alternative solutions.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To find the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}, we use the combination formula C(n, k), which gives us the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without regard to the order. Here, n = 10 and k = 4.; answer - 210\nSub-task 2.1 output: thinking - Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S. We need to calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 2 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 2 that don&#39;t. First, we choose 2 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 chosen numbers, which can be done in C(4, 2) ways. Then, we choose 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in the set S that were not chosen by Jen, which can be done in C(6, 2) ways. The total number of ways is the product of these two combinations.; answer - 90\nSub-task 2.2 output: thinking - To calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 3 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 1 that doesn&#39;t, we first need to choose 3 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers. There are C(4, 3) ways to do this. Then, we need to choose 1 number from the remaining numbers in the set S that is not in Jen&#39;s chosen numbers. Since Jen picked 4 numbers from 10, there are 6 numbers left in S. There are C(6, 1) ways to choose 1 number from these remaining numbers. So the total number of ways is C(4, 3) * C(6, 1).; answer - 24\nSub-task 2.3 output: thinking - To calculate the number of ways to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, we need to consider that Jen has already picked 4 numbers. There is exactly 1 way to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers because there is only one set of numbers that matches her set exactly.; answer - 1\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The probability of winning a prize is calculated by considering the cases where Jen has at least 2 matches. The number of ways to win with 2 matches is 90, with 3 matches is 24, and with 4 matches is 1. Adding these gives 115 ways to win a prize. The total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from 10 is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42. This calculation is correct and does not need further refinement.; answer - 23/42\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - Jen has already chosen 4 distinct numbers from the set S. There is only one specific combination of 4 numbers that will match Jen&#39;s chosen set. Therefore, the number of ways to pick 4 numbers from S such that all 4 of them match with Jen&#39;s chosen numbers is exactly 1.; answer - 1\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen has won a prize is calculated by dividing the number of ways to win the grand prize by the number of ways to win a prize. From sub-task 4, there is 1 way to win the grand prize. From sub-task 3, there are 115 ways to win a prize. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is 1/115.; answer - 1/115\nSub-task 6.3.3.1 output: thinking - To find the probability of winning a prize, we need to consider all cases where Jen matches at least 2 numbers. From the sub-tasks, we have the number of ways to match exactly 2 numbers (90 ways), exactly 3 numbers (24 ways), and exactly 4 numbers (1 way). The total number of ways to win a prize is the sum of these cases: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set S is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is 115/210. This fraction can be simplified to 23/42.; answer - 23/42\nSub-task 6.3.3.2 output: thinking - To find the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen won a prize, we need to calculate the probability of the event where all 4 numbers match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers out of all possible winning events. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers match the drawn numbers. From the sub-tasks, we have the number of ways for at least 2 matches: exactly 2 matches (90 ways), exactly 3 matches (24 ways), and exactly 4 matches (1 way). So, the total number of winning events is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The number of ways to win the grand prize (all 4 match) is 1. Thus, the probability is 1/115. In simplest form, this is already reduced, so m = 1 and n = 115. Therefore, m + n = 116.; answer - 116\nSub-task 6.3.3.3 output: thinking - We need to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize. From the previous sub-tasks, we calculated the probability of winning a prize as 23/42 and the probability of winning the grand prize as 1/115. However, the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize is the ratio of the probability of winning the grand prize to the probability of winning a prize. This is P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize), which is (1/115) / (23/42). Simplifying this, we get (1/115) * (42/23) = 42/(115*23). Simplifying 42/2645 gives us 6/377, so m = 6 and n = 377, and m + n = 383.; answer - 383&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent kOLq, on the purpose of calculating total ways to pick 4 numbers, thinking: To find the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}, we use the combination formula C(n, k), which gives us the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without regard to the order. Here, n = 10 and k = 4.; answer: 210\nCoT agent kOLq, on the purpose of calculating ways with exactly 2 matches, thinking: Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S. We need to calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 2 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 2 that don&#39;t. First, we choose 2 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 chosen numbers, which can be done in C(4, 2) ways. Then, we choose 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in the set S that were not chosen by Jen, which can be done in C(6, 2) ways. The total number of ways is the product of these two combinations.; answer: 90\nCoT agent kOLq, on the purpose of calculating ways with exactly 3 matches, thinking: To calculate the number of ways to pick exactly 3 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers and 1 that doesn&#39;t, we first need to choose 3 numbers from Jen&#39;s 4 numbers. There are C(4, 3) ways to do this. Then, we need to choose 1 number from the remaining numbers in the set S that is not in Jen&#39;s chosen numbers. Since Jen picked 4 numbers from 10, there are 6 numbers left in S. There are C(6, 1) ways to choose 1 number from these remaining numbers. So the total number of ways is C(4, 3) * C(6, 1).; answer: 24\nCoT agent kOLq, on the purpose of calculating ways with all matches, thinking: To calculate the number of ways to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers, we need to consider that Jen has already picked 4 numbers. There is exactly 1 way to pick all 4 numbers that match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers because there is only one set of numbers that matches her set exactly.; answer: 1\nCoT agent xrBs, on the purpose of calculating prize probability, thinking: To find the probability of winning a prize, we need to consider the cases where Jen wins at least 2 matches. From the sub-tasks, we have the number of ways to win with 2 matches (90 ways), 3 matches (24 ways), and 4 matches (1 way). The total number of outcomes is the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from 10, which is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is the sum of the ways to win (90 + 24 + 1) divided by the total number of outcomes (210).; answer: 115\nCritic agent lZaN, on the purpose of reviewing probability calculation, thinking: The calculation seems correct. The total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from 10 is indeed 210. The number of ways to win with at least 2 matches is 90 (2 matches) + 24 (3 matches) + 1 (4 matches) = 115. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210.; answer: The calculation is correct.\nCoT agent xrBs, on the purpose of refining prize probability, thinking: The calculation of the probability of winning a prize involves considering the cases where Jen has at least 2 matches. The number of ways to win with 2 matches is 90, with 3 matches is 24, and with 4 matches is 1. Adding these gives 115 ways to win a prize. The total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from 10 is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210.

The number of ways to win with at least 2 matches is calculated as 90 ways for 2 matches, 24 ways for 3 matches, and 1 way for 4 matches, totaling 115 ways to win a prize. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42. This matches the calculation presented and seems accurate.; answer: 115\nCoT agent xrBs, on the purpose of refining prize probability, thinking: The probability of winning a prize is calculated by considering the cases where Jen has at least 2 matches.

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42. This matches the provided answer and appears to be accurate.; answer: 23/42\nCoT agent xrBs, on the purpose of refining prize probability, thinking: The probability of winning a prize is calculated by considering the cases where Jen has at least 2 matches.

Therefore, the number of ways to pick 4 numbers from S such that all 4 of them match with Jen&#39;s chosen numbers is exactly 1.; answer: 1\nCoT agent kOLq, on the purpose of calculating grand prize probability, thinking: The probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen has won a prize is calculated by dividing the number of ways to win the grand prize by the number of ways to win a prize. From sub-task 4, there is 1 way to win the grand prize. From sub-task 3, there are 115 ways to win a prize. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given that a prize is won is 1/115.; answer: 1/115\nCoT agent kOLq, on the purpose of re-evaluating probability to win a prize, thinking: To find the probability of winning a prize, we need to consider all cases where Jen matches at least 2 numbers. From the sub-tasks, we have the number of ways to match exactly 2 numbers (90 ways), exactly 3 numbers (24 ways), and exactly 4 numbers (1 way). The total number of ways to win a prize is the sum of these cases: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The total number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the set S is 210. Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is 115/210. This fraction can be simplified to 23/42.; answer: 23/42\nCoT agent kOLq, on the purpose of re-evaluating probability to win the grand prize, thinking: To find the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen won a prize, we need to calculate the probability of the event where all 4 numbers match Jen&#39;s chosen numbers out of all possible winning events. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers match the drawn numbers. From the sub-tasks, we have the number of ways for at least 2 matches: exactly 2 matches (90 ways), exactly 3 matches (24 ways), and exactly 4 matches (1 way). So, the total number of winning events is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The number of ways to win the grand prize (all 4 match) is 1. Thus, the probability is 1/115. In simplest form, this is already reduced, so m = 1 and n = 115. Therefore, m + n = 116.; answer: 116\nCoT agent kOLq, on the purpose of calculating the probability of winning the grand prize given a prize, thinking: We need to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize. From the previous sub-tasks, we calculated the probability of winning a prize as 23/42 and the probability of winning the grand prize as 1/115. However, the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize is the ratio of the probability of winning the grand prize to the probability of winning a prize. This is P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize), which is (1/115) / (23/42). Simplifying this, we get (1/115) * (42/23) = 42/(115*23). Simplifying 42/2645 gives us 6/377, so m = 6 and n = 377, and m + n = 383.; answer: 383&#34;]

final_reponse: [&#39;We need to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize. From the previous sub-tasks, we calculated the probability of winning a prize as 23/42 and the probability of winning the grand prize as 1/115.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) Solvable: The sub-tasks are not fully solvable as evidenced by the incorrect final answer of 383. The current decomposition and architecture do not effectively solve the problem, particularly in calculating the conditional probability in Sub-task 6.3.3.3. This suggests that the task decomposition needs further refinement or a different approach to ensure each sub-task is manageable and solvable by the blocks.

Completeness: While the sub-tasks attempt to cover the necessary components of the problem, they fail to integrate all critical information effectively. The connections between sub-tasks need to be strengthened to ensure all relevant data is used in subsequent calculations.

Fitness: The fitness score remains at 0.0%, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This suggests that the current architecture or task decomposition does not effectively solve the problem, necessitating improvements to achieve a correct and comprehensive solution.

(2) Implementation Improvements: To improve the final answer, the implementation should include a more detailed breakdown of the number of ways to win any prize and the grand prize. This might involve further decomposing the sub-tasks or using a different block architecture to ensure all relevant combinations and probabilities are correctly calculated. Additionally, explicitly avoiding known incorrect answers in the final sub-task can guide the architecture towards a correct solution.

thought: To address the identified issues, I propose the following revisions:

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**:

For Sub-task 6.3.3.3, the instruction should include: &#34;It is known that 116, 157, and 383 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the architecture to avoid these incorrect final answers and encourage exploration of alternative solutions.

Additionally, ensure that the calculation of probabilities is accurate and that fractions are simplified correctly. Implement checks or guidance for simplifying fractions correctly within the sub-tasks.
