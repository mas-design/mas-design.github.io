    <pre>Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent zRWk:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. First, we determine the total number of ways Jen can win a prize by having at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. We do this by considering the cases of exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches. For exactly 2 matches, the number of ways is C(4, 2) * C(6, 2) = 6 * 15 = 90. For exactly 3 matches, it is C(4, 3) * C(6, 1) = 4 * 6 = 24. For exactly 4 matches, there is only 1 way, C(4, 4) = 1. Thus, the total number of ways to win a prize is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The number of ways to win the grand prize, where all 4 numbers match, is 1. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is 1/115. As 1 and 115 are relatively prime, m = 1 and n = 115. Therefore, m + n = 116.

### thinking by Debate Agent 9BSo:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she wins any prize. First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is C(10, 4) = 210. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her numbers match the drawn numbers. Calculate the number of ways for exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches: For exactly 2 matches, choose 2 from her numbers and 2 from the remaining 6: C(4, 2) * C(6, 2) = 6 * 15 = 90. For exactly 3 matches, choose 3 from her numbers and 1 from the remaining 6: C(4, 3) * C(6, 1) = 4 * 6 = 24. For exactly 4 matches, choose all 4 from her numbers: C(4, 4) = 1. Total ways to win a prize = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. The number of ways to win the grand prize is 1. The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is 1/115. Since 1 and 115 are relatively prime, m = 1 and n = 115. Therefore, m + n = 116.
