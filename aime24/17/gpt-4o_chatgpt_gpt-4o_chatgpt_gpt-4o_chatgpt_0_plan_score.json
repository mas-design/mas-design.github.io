    "thinking": "Answer ID 0 is selected as the best answer because it correctly identifies the solution to the problem by considering the symmetry of the equation and testing the symmetric case (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100). It also provides a clear explanation of why this is the only solution due to the symmetry of the equation. \n\nComparing with other answers:\n\n- Answer ID 1: This answer incorrectly assumes that setting a = 0 would simplify the problem to b^2c = 6,000,000, which does not lead to a valid solution under the given constraints. It fails to recognize the symmetry and the specific solution (100, 100, 100).\n\n- Answer ID 2: This answer correctly identifies (100, 100, 100) as a solution but initially incorrectly claims that a = b = c = 100 does not satisfy the second equation. It later corrects this, but the initial confusion might mislead the reader.\n\n- Answer ID 3: This answer correctly identifies the solution but lacks detailed reasoning and does not explain why other combinations are not possible.\n\n- Answer ID 5: This answer does not provide a correct solution and instead discusses the complexity of finding all possible triples without arriving at the correct number of solutions. It incorrectly provides an answer of 300, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.\n\n- Answer ID 6: This answer states that the problem is too complex to solve manually and suggests computational tools, which is unnecessary given the simplicity of the correct solution.\n\nThus, Answer ID 0 is the best choice as it provides a clear, correct, and complete explanation.",
