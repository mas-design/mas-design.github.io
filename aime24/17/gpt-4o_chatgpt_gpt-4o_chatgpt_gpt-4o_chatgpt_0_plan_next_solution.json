    "reflection": "(1) **Solvable:** The sub-tasks remain unsolvable with the current architecture due to their complexity, as indicated by the <TOO_HARD> markers. The suggestions consistently point towards using computational tools, indicating that the tasks are too complex for the existing blocks to handle effectively without additional breakdown or computational assistance.\n\n(2) **Completeness:** The sub-tasks attempt to address the necessary components of the problem, but they do not provide a feasible path to a solution given their current complexity. Further decomposition is needed to ensure that each sub-task is solvable by the blocks. The sub-tasks do not effectively break down the complexity of the polynomial equation, which is a critical aspect of the problem.\n\n(3) **Fitness:** The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. Improving the decomposition and ensuring that each sub-task is solvable by the blocks will help improve the fitness score.\n\n(2) **Improvements:** To improve the solvability and completeness of the sub-tasks, further decomposition is necessary. This involves breaking down the polynomial equation into smaller, more manageable components and exploring specific cases more thoroughly. Additionally, the use of computational tools should be integrated into the architecture to handle the complexity of the problem. This approach will make the tasks more manageable and solvable by the blocks, leading to a more accurate final answer.",
    "thought": "For case (a), **Further Decomposition:**\n\n1. **Last Sub-task 1** -> (further decompose to) **New Sub-task 1**: Generate all possible triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300, using combinatorial methods to list potential candidates.\n\n2. **New Sub-task 2**: Based on the outputs from new sub-task 1, explore specific cases such as a = b, a = c, or b = c to simplify the polynomial equation and identify patterns or simplifications.\n\n3. **New Sub-task 3**: Use the identified patterns or simplifications from new sub-task 2 to filter the triples and find those that satisfy the equation. This is a more focused task that can be handled by the Reflexion block.\n\nThese new sub-tasks break down the complex problem into more manageable pieces, focusing on specific cases to reduce the complexity of the polynomial equation. This ensures that the sub-tasks are solvable by the given blocks and can collectively achieve the final answer to the original question.",
