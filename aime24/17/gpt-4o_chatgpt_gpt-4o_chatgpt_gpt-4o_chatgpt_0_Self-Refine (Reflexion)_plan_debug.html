    <pre>We are given two equations to solve simultaneously: a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. Let&#39;s first consider the first equation, a + b + c = 300. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to this equation is given by the stars and bars method, which is (300 + 2 choose 2) = 45150. However, we need to satisfy the second equation as well. The second equation is symmetric in a, b, and c, suggesting that a, b, and c might be close to each other. Let&#39;s test some symmetric cases, such as a = b = c = 100, but this does not satisfy the second equation. Let&#39;s try a = 150, b = 150, c = 0, and permutations thereof. For a = 150, b = 150, c = 0, we have a + b + c = 300 and 150^2 * 0 + 150^2 * 0 + 150^2 * 150 + 150^2 * 0 + 0^2 * 150 + 0^2 * 150 = 150^3 = 3375000, which is not equal to 6000000. Trying permutations of these values and other combinations, let&#39;s test a = 100, b = 100, c = 100. Then a + b + c = 300, but a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 100^2*100 + 100^2*100 + 100^2*100 + 100^2*100 + 100^2*100 + 100^2*100 = 6 * 100^3 = 6000000, which satisfies the second equation. Thus, (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100) is a solution. Since the equation is symmetric, the only solution is (100, 100, 100) up to permutation, but since a = b = c, there are no permutations to consider. Therefore, the number of solutions is 1.
