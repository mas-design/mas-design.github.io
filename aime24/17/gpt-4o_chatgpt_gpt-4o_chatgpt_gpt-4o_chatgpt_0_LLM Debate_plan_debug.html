    <pre>Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}

### thinking by Debate Agent IgN2:
The problem involves finding triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a sum and a symmetric polynomial equation. The sum condition, a + b + c = 300, is straightforward. The second condition, a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000, is a symmetric polynomial. By examining the symmetry and testing possible values, we find that the solution a = 100, b = 100, c = 100 satisfies both equations. Given the symmetry and the constraints, this is likely the only solution.

### thinking by Debate Agent L3Rs:
We need to find triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. By symmetry, if a = b = c, then a = b = c = 100 satisfies both conditions: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 and 6 * 100^3 = 6,000,000. Due to the symmetric nature of the second equation, this is the only solution.

Given the symmetry of the polynomial and the constraints, this is likely the only solution where a, b, and c are equal, and no other combination satisfies both conditions.
