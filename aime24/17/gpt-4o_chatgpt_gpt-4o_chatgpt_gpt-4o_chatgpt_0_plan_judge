Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. First, notice that the expression a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b can be rewritten as (a^2)(b + c) + (b^2)(a + c) + (c^2)(a + b), which simplifies to a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c). This is a symmetric polynomial in a, b, c, and the constraint a + b + c = 300 allows us to express it in terms of two variables, say a and b, and the third variable c = 300 - a - b. By symmetry, we can attempt a few small values for a, b, c to see if they satisfy both conditions. After testing some values, we find that (100, 100, 100) satisfies both a + b + c = 300 and the second condition, because 100^2 * (100 + 100) = 100^2 * 200 = 2,000,000 for each term, and there are 3 such terms, summing to 6,000,000. Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, the only solution is when a = b = c = 100, and thus there is only 1 triple.

Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
proposed answer: To solve the problem, we first note that we have the equation a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. We can use symmetry and try small values for a, b, and c. If one of the variables is much larger than the others, it might simplify the problem. We try a = b = c = 100, but this does not satisfy the second equation. Let's try a = 0, then b + c = 300 and the equation becomes b^2c = 6,000,000. Solving for b and c gives a solution. Let's check if other combinations work.

Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
proposed answer: We are given two equations to solve simultaneously: a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. Let's first consider the first equation, a + b + c = 300. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to this equation is given by the stars and bars method, which is (300 + 2 choose 2) = 45150. However, we need to satisfy the second equation as well. The second equation is symmetric in a, b, and c, suggesting that a, b, and c might be close to each other. Let's test some symmetric cases, such as a = b = c = 100, but this does not satisfy the second equation. Let's try a = 150, b = 150, c = 0, and permutations thereof. For a = 150, b = 150, c = 0, we have a + b + c = 300 and 150^2 * 0 + 150^2 * 0 + 150^2 * 150 + 150^2 * 0 + 0^2 * 150 + 0^2 * 150 = 150^3 = 3375000, which is not equal to 6000000. Trying permutations of these values and other combinations, let's test a = 100, b = 100, c = 100. Then a + b + c = 300, but a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 100^2*100 + 100^2*100 + 100^2*100 + 100^2*100 + 100^2*100 + 100^2*100 = 6 * 100^3 = 6000000, which satisfies the second equation. Thus, (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100) is a solution. Since the equation is symmetric, the only solution is (100, 100, 100) up to permutation, but since a = b = c, there are no permutations to consider. Therefore, the number of solutions is 1.

Question: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}
proposed answer: The problem asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and the symmetric polynomial a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. By examining the symmetry and the constraints, we find that if a = b = c, then a = b = c = 100 satisfies both conditions: a + b + c = 300 and the polynomial equals 6 * 100^3 = 6,000,000. Given the symmetry of the polynomial and the constraints, this is likely the only solution where a, b, and c are equal, and no other combination satisfies both conditions.
