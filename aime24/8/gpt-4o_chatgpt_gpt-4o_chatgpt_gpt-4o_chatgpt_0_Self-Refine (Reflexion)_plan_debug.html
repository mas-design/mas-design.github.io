    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent JrRx (yourself):
To determine the number of positive integers n for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game&#39;s positions. A position is a losing position for the player whose turn it is if every possible move leaves the opponent in a winning position. Conversely, a position is a winning position if there is at least one move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. Let&#39;s identify the losing positions for Alice. If n = 0, Alice loses since she cannot make a move. Therefore, 0 is a losing position. If n = 1, Alice can remove 1 token and win, so 1 is a winning position. If n = 2, Alice can remove 1 token, leaving Bob with 1 (a winning position for Alice), so 2 is a losing position. If n = 3, Alice can remove 1 token, leaving Bob with 2 (a losing position for Bob), so 3 is a winning position. If n = 4, Alice can remove 4 tokens and win, so 4 is a winning position. If n = 5, Alice can remove 4 tokens, leaving Bob with 1 (a winning position for Alice), so 5 is a losing position. If n = 6, Alice can remove 1 token, leaving Bob with 5 (a losing position for Bob), so 6 is a winning position. If n = 7, Alice can remove 1 token, leaving Bob with 6 (a winning position for Alice), so 7 is a losing position. If n = 8, Alice can remove 4 tokens, leaving Bob with 4 (a winning position for Alice), so 8 is a losing position. The pattern here is that the losing positions are those where n = 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, and so on. The pattern repeats every 5 numbers: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 23, 24, 26, 29, etc. These are of the form 5k + 2, 5k + 3, 5k + 4, and 5k + 5 for non-negative integers k. We need to find how many such numbers are less than or equal to 2024. For numbers of the form 5k + 2, 5k + 3, 5k + 4, and 5k + 5, the largest k such that 5k + 5 &lt;= 2024 is k = 404. Therefore, there are 4 numbers (5k + 2, 5k + 3, 5k + 4, 5k + 5) for each k from 0 to 404, inclusive, which gives us 4 * 405 = 1620 numbers. These are the numbers for which Bob has a winning strategy.

### answer #1 by Chain-of-Thought Agent JrRx (yourself):
1620

### feedback #1 by Critic Agent 1HNZ:
The analysis of the losing positions is incorrect. The losing positions for the game are those where n is of the form 5k for non-negative integers k. Therefore, the number of losing positions is the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024, which is 405.
