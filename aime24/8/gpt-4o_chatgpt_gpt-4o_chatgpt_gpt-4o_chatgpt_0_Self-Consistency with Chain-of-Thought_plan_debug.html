    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to determine the losing positions for Alice, which will be the winning positions for Bob when it&#39;s his turn. A position is a losing position if every move leads to a winning position for the opponent. We can determine the nature of each position by analyzing small values of n and generalizing.

1. Base case: If n = 0, the player to move loses. So, position 0 is a losing position.
2. For n = 1, Alice can take 1 token and win, so n = 1 is a winning position.
3. For n = 2, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1, which is a winning position for Bob. So, n = 2 is a losing position.
4. For n = 3, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 2, which is a losing position for Bob. So, n = 3 is a winning position.
5. For n = 4, Alice can take 4 tokens and win, so n = 4 is a winning position.
6. For n = 5, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1, which is a winning position for Bob. Thus, n = 5 is a losing position.

Continuing this reasoning, we observe that the losing positions (positions where the player to move cannot force a win) follow a pattern: every 5th number starting from 0 is a losing position. This is because:
- If n is a losing position, then n+1, n+2, n+3, and n+4 are winning positions (since Alice can move to a losing position in each case).
- Then, n+5 becomes a losing position again because Alice can only move to winning positions.

Thus, the losing positions are 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, ..., which are of the form 5k + 2.

Now, we need to count how many such losing positions (5k + 2) are less than or equal to 2024.

To find the largest k such that 5k + 2 &lt;= 2024:
5k + 2 &lt;= 2024
=&gt; 5k &lt;= 2022
=&gt; k &lt;= 404.4

The largest integer k is 404.

Therefore, the losing positions are 5(0) + 2, 5(1) + 2, ..., 5(404) + 2.
There are 404 + 1 = 405 such positions.

Thus, there are 405 positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win.
