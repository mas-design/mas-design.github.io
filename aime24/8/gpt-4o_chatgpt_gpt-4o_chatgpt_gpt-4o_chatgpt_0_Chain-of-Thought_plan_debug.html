    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To determine the winning and losing positions, we analyze the game starting from small values of n. A position is a losing position if every move from that position leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is a winning position if there is at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent. Let&#39;s start with small values of n and build up: 

- n = 1: Alice can take 1 token and win, so n = 1 is a winning position for Alice.
- n = 2: Alice takes 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob, who then wins. So n = 2 is a losing position for Alice.
- n = 3: Alice takes 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for Bob, who is in a losing position. So n = 3 is a winning position for Alice.
- n = 4: Alice can take all 4 tokens and win, so n = 4 is a winning position for Alice.
- n = 5: Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 token for Bob, who wins. So n = 5 is a losing position for Alice.

Continuing this pattern, we find that n = 6 is a winning position (Alice takes 4, leaving 2, which is losing for Bob). n = 7 is a winning position (Alice takes 4, leaving 3, which is winning for Alice). n = 8 is a winning position (Alice takes 4, leaving 4, which is winning for Alice). n = 9 is a losing position (Alice takes 4, leaving 5, which is losing for Alice).

The pattern that emerges is that positions n that are multiples of 5 (n = 5, 10, 15, ...) are losing positions for Alice, meaning they are winning positions for Bob. This is because from a position that is a multiple of 5, Alice can only move to a position that is not a multiple of 5, which is a winning position for Bob.

To find the number of such positions less than or equal to 2024, we need to count the multiples of 5 from 1 to 2024. The smallest multiple of 5 is 5, and the largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020. The sequence of multiples of 5 is 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020.

The number of terms in this sequence is given by the formula: (last term - first term) / step size + 1 = (2020 - 5) / 5 + 1 = 403.

Therefore, there are 403 positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.
