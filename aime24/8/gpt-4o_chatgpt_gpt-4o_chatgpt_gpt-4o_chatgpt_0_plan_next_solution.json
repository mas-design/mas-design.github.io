        "Solvable": "The sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponding blocks, as they do not contain <TOO_HARD> and provide coherent answers. However, the repeated incorrect final response suggests an underlying issue in the problem-solving strategy or logic applied in the sub-tasks. Specifically, the final sub-task's logic seems flawed, leading to incorrect conclusions.",
        "Completeness": "The sub-tasks include necessary steps, but the connection between sub-tasks and the overall strategy might need refinement to ensure the solution aligns with the original question's requirements. The sub-tasks should clearly connect to the main problem and ensure the correct aggregation of information.",
        "Fitness": "The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. This suggests that the current decomposition and architecture are not effectively solving the problem. Adjustments in the task decomposition or the architecture might be needed to improve the final response."

This further decomposition aims to ensure a clear understanding of the strategy and validate it with examples, making the task more manageable and directly related to the problem.",
