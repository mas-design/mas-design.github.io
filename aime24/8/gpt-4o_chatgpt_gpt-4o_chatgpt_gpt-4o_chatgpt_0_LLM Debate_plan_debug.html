    <pre>Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice&#39;s play.

### thinking by Debate Agent l39f:
To find the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to determine the losing positions for Alice. By analyzing the game, we notice that positions where n % 5 == 0 or n % 5 == 2 are losing for Alice, meaning they are winning for Bob. For n % 5 == 0, the sequence is 5, 10, ..., 2020. The number of terms in this sequence is (2020 - 5)/5 + 1 = 404. For n % 5 == 2, the sequence is 2, 7, ..., 2022. The number of terms in this sequence is (2022 - 2)/5 + 1 = 405. Therefore, the total number of such positions is 404 + 405 = 809.

To determine the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the positions where Bob can guarantee a win. These positions are losing for Alice. By analyzing the game, we see that positions where n % 5 == 0 or n % 5 == 2 are losing for Alice, thus winning for Bob. For n % 5 == 0, the sequence is 5, 10, ..., 2020. The number of terms is (2020 - 5)/5 + 1 = 404. For n % 5 == 2, the sequence is 2, 7, ..., 2022. The number of terms is (2022 - 2)/5 + 1 = 405. The total number of such positions is 404 + 405 = 809.
