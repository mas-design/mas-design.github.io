    <pre>Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

    <pre>We have eight circles of radius 34 arranged in a chain such that two of them are tangent to the sides AB and BC of a triangle ABC. Similarly, 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. This suggests that the number of circles and their radii are related to the inradius of the triangle.

Consider the configuration of circles: the centers of the circles form a polygonal chain that is tangent to the incircle of the triangle. For the eight circles of radius 34, the total length of the chain is 8 times the diameter of one circle, which is 8 * 68.

For the 2024 circles of radius 1, the total length of the chain is 2024 times the diameter of one circle, which is 2024 * 2.

These lengths are equal to the semiperimeter of the triangle minus the side that the chain is tangent to. Therefore, these lengths are equal to the semiperimeter minus the base of the triangle.

The length of the chain for the radius 34 circles is 8 * 68 = 544.
The length of the chain for the radius 1 circles is 2024 * 2 = 4048.

The ratio of these lengths gives the ratio of the inradii of the triangles formed by the two configurations.

Let r be the inradius of the triangle with the large circles. The inradius of the triangle with the small circles is 1. The ratio of the inradii is the same as the ratio of the chain lengths, so we have:

r / 1 = 544 / 4048

Simplifying 544 / 4048 gives 544 / 4048 = 1 / 7.5 = 2 / 15.

Thus, r = 2 / 15.

The inradius of triangle ABC is 2 / 15, which can be expressed as m/n where m and n are relatively prime. Here, m = 2 and n = 15.

Therefore, m + n = 2 + 15 = 17.
