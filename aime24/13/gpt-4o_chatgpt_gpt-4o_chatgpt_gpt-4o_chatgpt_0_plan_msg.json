Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)\n\nYour objective is to \n\n(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like 'output exactly the following...' is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.\n\nMake sure \n\n(a) Include sub-task ID  and 'Based on (task i)' in the instruction of a sub-task. \nFor example, \nSimilarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2's instruction should be\n'Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1's instruction)'\n\nSimilarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3's instruction should be\n'Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3's instruction)'\nThis helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task \nFor example,\n`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`\nYou can see it clearly states 'based on what sub-tasks'\n\n(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. \n\n(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. \nYou should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.\n\nFor example, if the exising architectures are 'COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate' and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:\n\nExample Setup\n\nResulting sub-tasks:\nsub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4\n\nAvailable architectures:\nCOT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate\n\nNetwork with 3 Layers:\n\nLayer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  \nLayer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   \nLayer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  \n\nConnection Strategies:\n\n1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.\nExample: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -> [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)\n\n2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.\nExample: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -> [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -> [COT -> Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -> Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\n1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.\n\n2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. \n\nYour aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the 'code' entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\n\n\n# The utility code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom typing import Union\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\n\nimport openai\nimport backoff\nfrom utils import random_id\n\n# Initialize the OpenAI client\nclient = openai.OpenAI()\n\n# Named tuple for holding task information\nInfo = namedtuple('Info', ['name', 'author', 'content', 'prompt', 'sub_tasks', 'agents', 'iteration_idx'])\n\n# Format instructions for LLM response\nFORMAT_INST = lambda request_keys: f\"Reply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{str(request_keys)}\nDO NOT MISS ANY FIELDS AND MAKE SURE THE JSON FORMAT IS CORRECT!\n\"\n\n# Description of the role for the LLM\nROLE_DESC = lambda role: f\"You are a {role}.\"\n\n@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, openai.RateLimitError)\ndef get_json_response_from_gpt(msg, model, system_message, temperature=0.5):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to get JSON response from GPT model.\n    \n    Args:\n    - msg (str): The user message.\n    - model (str): The model to use.\n    - system_message (str): The system message.\n    - temperature (float): Sampling temperature.\n    \n    Returns:\n    - dict: The JSON response.\n    \"\"\"\n    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_message},\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": msg},\n        ],\n        temperature=temperature,\n        max_tokens=1024,\n        stop=None,\n        response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n    )\n    content = response.choices[0].message.content\n    json_dict = json.loads(content)\n    return json_dict\n\nclass LLMAgentBase():\n    \"\"\"\n    Attributes:\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, output_fields: list, agent_name: str,\n                 role='helpful assistant', model=None, temperature=None) -> None:\n        self.output_fields = output_fields\n        self.agent_name = agent_name\n\n        self.role = role\n        self.model = model\n        self.temperature = temperature\n        #

You can get the content by Infos.content. \nDO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.\n\n\n## WRONG Implementation examples:\nHere are some mistakes you may make:\n\n1. This is WRONG: ```\nfeedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)\nfeedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)\n```\nIt is wrong to use \"Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)\". The returned \"feedback\" from LLMAgentBase is already Info.\n\n2. This is WRONG: ```\n# Debugging: Log the generated answer\nprint('Generated Answer:', ...)\nfeedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)\nif len(feedback_info) < 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements\n    return 'Error: Feedback info incomplete'\n```\nFirst, the len(feedback_info) will not work.\nSecond, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.\nThird, you should never print anything in the code.\nLastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.\n\n3. This is WRONG: ```\nall_thinking = []\nall_answers = []\nfor agent, role in zip(agents, roles):\n    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))\n    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)\n    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)\n\n# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers\naggregated_thinking = '\n'.join(all_thinking)\naggregated_answers = '\n'.join(all_answers)\n```\nYou SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.\n\n4. This is WRONG: ```\nreasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')\nresponse_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\n    \n# Extract the final answer from the response_infos\nfor info in response_infos:\n    if info.name == 'final_answer':\n        return info\n# Fallback if no answer is found\nreturn Info('answer', 'Final Decision Agent', 'No answer generated.', 0)\n```\n\n5. This is WRONG: ```\nreasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')\nthinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\nreturn answer   \n```\nYou MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.\n\n6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```\nthinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\n```\nYou MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition\n\n7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```\nreasoning_instruction = '...'\n```\nYou MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks\n\n\nYou should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.\nCORRECT example: ```\nreasoning_instruction = 'Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....'\nreasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')\nthinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\nfinal_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)\n\n# Return only the final answer\nreturn final_answer   \n```\n\n\n\n# Your task\nYou are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature.

            "thought": "\n    **Decomposition:**\n    \n    To solve the given problem, we need to break it down into manageable sub-tasks that align with the capabilities of the existing architectures in the archive. Here's how the decomposition is structured:\n\n    1. **Sub-task 1:** Calculate the total length of the path on which the circles are tangent. This involves understanding how the circles of radius 34 are arranged and calculating the length of the path they form.\n       - This sub-task is straightforward as it involves basic geometry and arithmetic, which can be effectively handled by a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process.\n\n    2. **Sub-task 2:** Calculate the total length of the path for the 2024 circles of radius 1 arranged in the same manner. This is similar to Sub-task 1 but requires handling a larger number of smaller circles.\n       - Again, this is a straightforward geometric calculation suitable for CoT.\n\n    3. **Sub-task 3:** Determine the ratio of the total lengths calculated in Sub-task 1 and Sub-task 2. This ratio will help in understanding the scaling factor between the two arrangements.\n       - This sub-task involves simple arithmetic and ratio calculation, which can be handled by CoT.\n\n    4. **Sub-task 4:** Use the ratio and the properties of the circles to find the inradius of triangle ABC. This involves applying the geometric properties of the arrangement to deduce the inradius.\n       - This sub-task requires deeper reasoning and can be effectively handled by a Self-Refine (Reflexion) process, allowing iterative refinement based on feedback.\n\n    5. **Sub-task 5:** Express the inradius as a fraction in simplest form and find the sum of the numerator and denominator.\n       - This involves simplifying the fraction and is suitable for CoT.\n\n    **Overall Architecture:**\n    \n    The architecture I propose consists of multiple layers, each addressing a specific sub-task with the appropriate block from the archive:\n    \n    - **Layer 1:** Handles Sub-task 1 and Sub-task 2 using CoT for straightforward geometric calculations.\n    - **Layer 2:** Addresses Sub-task 3 using CoT for ratio calculation.\n    - **Layer 3:** Uses Reflexion (Self-Refine) to iteratively determine the inradius for Sub-task 4.\n    - **Layer 4:** Utilizes CoT to simplify the inradius expression and calculate the final answer for Sub-task 5.\n\n    **Implementation:**\n    \n    The implementation involves connecting the blocks as follows:\n    \n    1. CoT (address Sub-task 1) -> CoT (address Sub-task 2)\n    2. CoT (address Sub-task 2) -> CoT (address Sub-task 3)\n    3. CoT (address Sub-task 3) -> Reflexion (address Sub-task 4)\n    4. Reflexion (address Sub-task 4) -> CoT (address Sub-task 5)\n\n    This approach ensures that each sub-task is addressed by the most suitable block, leveraging the strengths of each architecture to solve the problem efficiently.\n    ",

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly.

It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture.

Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer?

The repeated suggestions highlight the need for deeper exploration of geometric properties and potentially additional assumptions or data about the triangle.\n\n(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not encapsulate all necessary geometric insights or theorems needed to connect the circle configurations to the inradius of the triangle. This lack of completeness prevents the effective aggregation of sub-task responses into a comprehensive final answer.\n\n(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains at 0%, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The final response suggests a lack of understanding of the geometric relationship between the circle configurations and the inradius.

However, the previous sub-task indicates that there is insufficient information to calculate the area of the triangle directly, as the semiperimeter and inradius are not known. Without the area or more specific details about the triangle's dimensions or the arrangement of circles, it is difficult to determine the inradius. The problem requires more details about the dimensions of triangle ABC, the arrangement of the circles, and any relationships between the circles and the triangle's sides. This would help in determining the semiperimeter or directly finding the inradius.; answer: <TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Provide more information about the dimensions of triangle ABC, the arrangement of the circles, and any relationships between the circles and the triangle's sides. This would help in determining the semiperimeter or directly finding the inradius.\nCritic agent Dywp, on the purpose of criticizing inradius calculation, thinking: The problem is indeed complex due to the lack of specific information about the triangle's dimensions and the arrangement of circles. The calculation of the inradius requires knowledge of the semiperimeter or the area of the triangle, which is not provided. Without additional details, it is challenging to accurately determine the inradius.; answer: True\nCoT agent C527, on the purpose of simplifying inradius fraction, thinking: The problem involves finding the inradius of a triangle given a specific arrangement of circles tangent to the triangle's sides and each other. We have information about two arrangements of circles with different radii, but the connection to the triangle's dimensions is unclear. Without explicit details about how the circles relate to the triangle's sides and vertices, calculating the inradius directly is challenging. The problem seems to require a specific geometric configuration or additional relationships between the circles and the triangle that are not provided.; answer: 68\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Clarify the geometric relationship between the circles and the triangle, such as how the circles are tangent to the sides and any specific distances or angles involved.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

This indicates that these tasks are too complex for the current decomposition. The suggestions provided after <TOO_HARD> highlight the need for additional geometric insights or assumptions about the triangle. The fact that sub-task 5 yields an incorrect answer suggests that further decomposition or additional assumptions are necessary.\n\n(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not fully capture all necessary geometric insights or theorems needed to connect the circle configurations to the inradius of the triangle. This lack of completeness prevents effective aggregation of sub-task responses into a comprehensive final answer.\n\n(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains at 0%, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The final response suggests a lack of understanding of the geometric relationship between the circle configurations and the inradius. To improve the fitness score, the architecture needs to incorporate more detailed geometric insights or assumptions.\n\nTo address these issues, I suggest further decomposing sub-task 4 into more specific steps that involve identifying and applying relevant geometric properties or theorems.

The angle bisectors often relate to the points of tangency of the incircle and excircles of the triangle. If circles are tangent to the sides of the triangle, the angle bisectors may pass through the centers of these circles or relate to points where the circles are tangent to the sides. In the given problem, the circles are tangent to the sides AB and BC, suggesting that the angle bisectors of angles A and C might intersect the centers of these tangent circles or relate to their tangency points. These bisectors help establish geometric relationships and symmetry within the configuration, potentially aiding in the calculation of distances such as the inradius.; answer - The angle bisectors in tangent circle configurations with respect to triangle ABC help determine points of tangency and relate to the centers of tangent circles, providing symmetry and aiding in geometric calculations.\nSub-task 4.1.2.1.2 output: thinking - The angle bisectors influence the arrangement and tangency of circles by determining the line along which the centers of the tangent circles lie.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

The suggestions highlight the need for more detailed geometric insights or assumptions about the triangle, which are currently lacking.\n\n(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not include all necessary geometric insights or theorems needed to connect the circle configurations to the inradius of the triangle. This omission prevents the effective aggregation of sub-task responses into a comprehensive final answer.\n\n(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains at 0%, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The final response suggests a lack of understanding of the geometric relationship between the circle configurations and the inradius. To improve the fitness score, the architecture needs to incorporate more detailed geometric insights or assumptions.\n\nTo address these issues, I suggest further decomposing sub-task 4 into more specific steps that involve identifying and applying relevant geometric properties or theorems.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one.

Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f'').

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

This indicates that the tasks are too complex for the current decomposition and require further breakdown or additional information. The repeated suggestions highlight the need for deeper exploration of geometric properties and potentially additional assumptions or data about the triangle.\n\n(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not fully capture all necessary geometric insights or theorems needed to connect the circle configurations to the inradius of the triangle. This lack of completeness prevents the effective aggregation of sub-task responses into a comprehensive final answer.\n\n(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains at 0%, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The final response suggests a lack of understanding of the geometric relationship between the circle configurations and the inradius. This needs to be addressed by incorporating more detailed geometric insights or assumptions in the updated architecture.\n\nTo address these issues, I suggest further decomposing sub-task 4 into even more specific steps that involve identifying and applying relevant geometric properties or theorems.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

This indicates that the tasks are too complex for the current decomposition and require further breakdown or additional information. The repeated suggestions highlight the need for deeper exploration of geometric properties and potentially additional assumptions or data about the triangle.\n\n(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not fully capture all necessary geometric insights or theorems needed to connect the circle configurations to the inradius of the triangle. This lack of completeness prevents the effective aggregation of sub-task responses into a comprehensive final answer.\n\n(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains at 0%, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The final response suggests a lack of understanding of the geometric relationship between the circle configurations and the inradius. This needs to be addressed by incorporating more detailed geometric insights or assumptions in the updated architecture.\n\nTo address these issues, I suggest further decomposing sub-task 4 into even more specific steps that involve identifying and applying relevant geometric properties or theorems.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

            "reflection": "(1) **Solvable**: The architecture is still struggling with solvability, as indicated by the persistent <TOO_HARD> responses for several sub-tasks, such as 4.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1, 4.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2, 4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1, 4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2, 4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1, 4.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.2, and 4.2.2. This indicates that the tasks are too complex for the current decomposition and require further breakdown or additional information. The repeated suggestions highlight the need for deeper exploration of geometric properties and potentially additional assumptions or data about the triangle.\n\n(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not fully capture all necessary geometric insights or theorems needed to connect the circle configurations to the inradius of the triangle. This lack of completeness prevents the effective aggregation of sub-task responses into a comprehensive final answer.\n\n(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains at 0%, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The final response suggests a lack of understanding of the geometric relationship between the circle configurations and the inradius. This needs to be addressed by incorporating more detailed geometric insights or assumptions in the updated architecture.\n\nTo address these issues, I suggest further decomposing sub-task 4 into even more specific steps that involve identifying and applying relevant geometric properties or theorems. Additionally, updating the sub-task instruction to avoid known incorrect answers is crucial.",

This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue.

Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer?

Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one.

Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"
