    <pre>Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

    <pre>We have a sequence of tangent circles, and we need to relate this configuration to the inradius of triangle ABC. The key is to understand the arrangement of circles and how they relate to the inradius. We have eight circles of radius 34, and then 2024 circles of radius 1. We are given that the inradius of triangle ABC can be expressed as a fraction. Let&#39;s analyze the situation step by step. The circles are sequentially tangent, forming a chain. Two specific circles are tangent to sides AB and BC of the triangle, respectively. We need to find the inradius of the triangle. For the eight circles of radius 34, the total length they cover is 8 * 2 * 34 = 544. For the 2024 circles of radius 1, the total length they cover is 2024 * 2 * 1 = 4048. Notice that the ratio of the lengths covered by these circles is the same as the ratio of the radii of the circles (34:1), which suggests a proportionality in the triangle&#39;s dimensions. The inradius of the triangle is determined by the geometry of the circles. The inradius is proportional to the radius of the circles, with the constant of proportionality being the same for both configurations. We calculate the inradius for the 34-radius circles and use the same ratio to find the inradius for the 1-radius circles. The inradius for the 34-radius circles is 34, and for the 1-radius circles, it is 1. Therefore, the inradius of the triangle with the 1-radius circles is 1/34 of the inradius with the 34-radius circles. The inradius of the triangle with the 34-radius circles is 34, so the inradius for the 1-radius circles is 34/1 = 34. The final step is to express the inradius of the triangle with the 1-radius circles in simplest form, which is 34. Therefore, the inradius can be expressed as 34/1, and m+n = 34+1 = 35.
