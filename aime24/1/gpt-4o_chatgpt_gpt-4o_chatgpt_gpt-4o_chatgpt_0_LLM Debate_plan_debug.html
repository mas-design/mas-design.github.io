    <pre>Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent Qour:
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of tangents and symmedians. Since D is the intersection of the tangents to the circle at points B and C, AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC. The symmedian divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the other two sides. Using the given side lengths, we can calculate AP using the symmedian properties. Specifically, AP is found using the formula for the length of the symmedian: AP = \frac{2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot BC}{AB^2 + AC^2}. Substituting the given side lengths AB = 5, AC = 10, and BC = 9, we calculate AP = \frac{25}{3}. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 3, giving m + n = 28.

### thinking by Debate Agent Ot1J:
The problem involves using the properties of the symmedian in triangle ABC. Since D is the intersection of tangents from B and C, AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC. The symmedian divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the other two sides. To find AP, we use the symmedian length formula: AP = \frac{2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot BC}{AB^2 + AC^2}. Substituting the given side lengths AB = 5, AC = 10, and BC = 9, we calculate AP = \frac{25}{3}. Therefore, m = 25 and n = 3, giving m + n = 28.
