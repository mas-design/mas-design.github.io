    <pre>Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to use properties of circle geometry. The tangents to a circle from a point are equal, so DB = DC. Also, by the power of a point theorem, DA^2 = DB * DC. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the exsimilicenter of the circle and the line at infinity, and AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC. The symmedian point divides the median in the ratio of the squares of the sides, so we use the formula for the length of the symmedian segment AD to find AP. The symmedian divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the adjacent sides, which helps in finding AP using the power of a point.
