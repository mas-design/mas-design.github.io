    "reflection": "(1) **Solvable**: The architecture struggles with sub-tasks 3.2.2.1 and 3.2.2.2, both marked as <TOO_HARD>. This suggests the numerical approximation task is too complex for the current setup. The suggestions after <TOO_HARD> were not effectively implemented, leading to a bottleneck. The sub-tasks need specific numerical methods and parameters, which were not adequately defined. \n\n**Completeness**: The sub-tasks attempt to cover necessary steps, but the numerical approximation complexity remains a barrier. The inability to solve sub-task 3.2.2.2 affects sub-tasks 4 and 5, leaving them unsolved.\n\n**Fitness**: The fitness remains low due to the incorrect final response. The repeated incorrect answers in memory show the architecture does not yet lead to a correct solution. The final answer must be recalculated based on a correct approximation of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n(2) The implementation needs to address the missing numerical method specification and parameters to improve the solvability of sub-task 3.2.2.2. By specifying a numerical method and its parameters, the architecture can proceed with the iterative process to refine the approximation for \\(x\\). This would involve using a computational tool or a more detailed step-by-step approach to manually approximate the solution.",
    "thought": "\n**Further Decomposition:**\nThe previous decomposition needs further refinement to address the complexity of sub-task 3.2.2. The sub-task 3.2.2 needs to be broken down further:\n\n- **Last sub-task 3.2.2:** Implement the numerical method to approximate the value for \\(x\\).\n\n- **New sub-task 3.2.2.1:** Specify the numerical method (e.g., Newton's method) and its parameters, such as tolerance and maximum iterations.\n\n- **New sub-task 3.2.2.2:** Apply the specified numerical method iteratively to approximate \\(x\\).\n\nThis further decomposition ensures that each sub-task is easier and provides a clear path to the final solution.\n\n**Improved Subtask Architecture:**\nThe architecture needs to be revised to address the further decomposed sub-tasks effectively:\n\n- **Last sub-task architecture (Self-Refine for sub-task 3.2.2):**\n\n- **New sub-task architecture:**\n  - Use \"Chain-of-Thought\" for new sub-task 3.2.2.1 to specify the numerical method and its parameters.\n  - Use \"Self-Refine (Reflexion)\" for new sub-task 3.2.2.2 to apply the method iteratively and refine the approximation.\n\nThis revised architecture ensures that each sub-task is addressed by the most suitable block, and the connection between sub-tasks is clear and logical.\n\n**Updated Subtask Instruction:**\nFor sub-task 5, update the instruction to avoid incorrect answers based on memory: \"It is known that (1000, 100, 81, 5, 64, 10) are not correct.\" This ensures the architecture avoids previously incorrect solutions.",
