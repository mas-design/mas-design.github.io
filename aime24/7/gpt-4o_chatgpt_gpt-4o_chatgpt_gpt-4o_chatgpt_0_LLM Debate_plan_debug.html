    <pre>There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.

### thinking by Debate Agent bT20:
We have two equations: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). Rewriting these using properties of logarithms, the first equation becomes \( x \log(y) = 10 \log(x) \), and the second equation becomes \( 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y) \). Solving these, we find that \( x = y^4 \). Substituting \( x = y^4 \) into \( y^x = x^{10} \), we get \( y^{y^4} = (y^4)^{10} \), which simplifies to \( y^{y^4} = y^{40} \), implying \( y^4 = 40 \) and thus \( y = \sqrt[4]{40} \). Consequently, \( x = (\sqrt[4]{40})^4 = 40 \). Therefore, \( xy = 40 \times \sqrt[4]{40} \).

### thinking by Debate Agent Vx6o:
Both agents derived the equations \( y^x = x^{10} \) and \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \) from the logarithmic identities. Solving these equations, they found \( x = y^4 \). Substituting \( x = y^4 \) into the first equation gives \( y^{y^4} = (y^4)^{10} \), which simplifies to \( y^{y^4} = y^{40} \). This implies \( y^4 = 40 \), so \( y = 40^{1/4} \) and \( x = 40 \). Therefore, \( xy = 40 \times 40^{1/4} \).

### answer by Debate Agent bT20:
40 \times 40^{1/4}

### answer by Debate Agent Vx6o:
40 \times 40^{1/4}

Given all the above thinking and answers, reason over them carefully and provide a final answer.</pre>
