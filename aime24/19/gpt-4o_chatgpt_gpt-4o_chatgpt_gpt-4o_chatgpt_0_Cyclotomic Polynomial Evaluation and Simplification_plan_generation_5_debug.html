    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```

Below is the question to solve:

Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

    <pre>thought: To solve this complex problem involving a 13th root of unity, we need to break it down into simpler, manageable sub-tasks that our existing architectures can handle effectively. Here&#39;s how we can decompose the problem:

**Decomposition:**
1. **Sub-task 1:** Calculate the expression \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) for each \(k\) from 0 to 12. This task involves understanding the powers of \(\omega\) and how they interact in the given expression. The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) architecture is well-suited for this task as it can handle step-by-step reasoning and calculations.

2. **Sub-task 2:** Compute the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). This sub-task requires multiplying all the results from Sub-task 1. The Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought (COT-SC) can be used here to ensure accurate multiplication through repeated calculations and majority voting.

3. **Sub-task 3:** Find the remainder of the product from Sub-task 2 when divided by 1000. This is a straightforward modulo operation, which can be effectively handled by the Reflexion architecture to refine the answer if necessary.

**Overall Architecture:**
To address each sub-task effectively, we will connect the existing blocks as follows:

- **CoT (address Sub-task 1):** This block will handle the calculation of each term in the product, ensuring detailed step-by-step reasoning.
- **COT-SC (address Sub-task 2):** This block will take the results from Sub-task 1 and compute the product, using self-consistency to ensure accuracy.
- **Reflexion (address Sub-task 3):** This block will take the product from Sub-task 2 and perform the modulo operation, refining the solution through feedback if needed.

**Implementation:**
We&#39;ll implement this architecture by setting up the connections between these blocks, ensuring that each sub-task is addressed by the appropriate block. We&#39;ll also track the output of each sub-task for the final answer.

The product of (1 - omega^k) over all k from 0 to 12 is the same as the product of (1 - z) over all 13th roots of unity z (except z = 1). This product is equal to 13, because the polynomial for 13th roots of unity is x^13 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1), and the product of roots of x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1 is 13 by Vieta&#39;s formulas.

To find the product of all terms, I recognize that the product over all 13th roots of unity of a polynomial of degree less than 13 is related to the polynomial evaluated at 1. Here, the polynomial is P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2, and we need to find the product of P(omega^k) for k = 0 to 12. Since omega^13 = 1, the product is P(1) = 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 1. Therefore, the product is 1.; answer: 1\nCoT agent 1pQT, on the purpose of computing product, thinking: The expression 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) can be rewritten as (1 - omega^k)^2. Since omega is a 13th root of unity, the product over k from 0 to 12 of (1 - omega^k) is known to be 13 due to the cyclotomic polynomial properties. Therefore, the product of (1 - omega^k)^2 is 13^2 = 169.; answer: 169\nCoT agent QzRj, on the purpose of computing product, thinking: To compute the product of all terms, we recognize that the expression 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) can be rewritten using properties of roots of unity. For each k, we have 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) = (1 - omega^k)^2. The product over all k from 0 to 12 of (1 - omega^k)^2 is the square of the product of (1 - omega^k) for all k. Since omega is a 13th root of unity, the product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 1 to 12 is 13, due to a known result about cyclotomic polynomials. Therefore, the product we are interested in is 13^2 = 169.; answer: 169\nCoT agent iaTt, on the purpose of computing product, thinking: The expression for each k is 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k). Notice that omega is a 13th root of unity, so omega^13 = 1. We can simplify omega^(2k) using the fact that omega^13 = 1. For example, omega^12 = 1, omega^14 = omega, and so on. The product of these expressions for k = 0 to 12 is the product of these 13 terms. However, computing this directly for each k is complex due to the roots of unity properties. Instead, we can use the symmetry of roots of unity and properties of cyclotomic polynomials. The expression 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) can be rewritten as (1 - omega^k)^2, and the product becomes the square of the product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12. The product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 1 to 12 is known to be the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at 1, which is 13. Thus, the product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is (1 - 1) * 13 = 0. Therefore, the product of (1 - omega^k)^2 is 0, so the remainder when divided by 1000 is 0.; answer: 0\nCoT agent DUer, on the purpose of computing product, thinking: The expression 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) is equivalent to (1 - omega^k)^2. The product of (1 - omega^k) over all k from 0 to 12 is the same as the product of (1 - z) over all 13th roots of unity z (except z = 1). This product is equal to 13, because the polynomial for 13th roots of unity is x^13 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1), and the product of roots of x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1 is 13 by Vieta&#39;s formulas.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:** The sub-tasks are not entirely solvable as evidenced by incorrect answers and low fitness scores. The output for Sub-task 2, where the product of terms is calculated, incorrectly states the product as 169. The correct approach involves recognizing the nature of cyclotomic polynomials and roots of unity, which seems to be misunderstood. This indicates that the task is too complex for the COT-SC block and needs further decomposition.

**Completeness:** The sub-tasks include relevant information, but the connection between them seems to be weak, particularly in ensuring the correct application of mathematical properties related to roots of unity.

**Fitness:** The fitness score remains at 0.0%, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The architecture needs to be revised to improve the accuracy of sub-task outputs and the final answer.

(2) **Improvement Suggestions:**
- **Further Decomposition:** The calculation of the product using cyclotomic properties needs to be broken down further into simpler steps that the LLM can handle. This could involve explicitly computing intermediate steps of the polynomial evaluation and ensuring that the properties of roots of unity are correctly applied.
- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Explicitly mention that certain incorrect answers should be avoided in the final sub-task to steer the LLM away from common pitfalls. This should help in refining the final answer.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    Last sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2a: Calculate the product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 using cyclotomic polynomial properties. New sub-task 2b: Square the result from 2a to find the final product. This decomposition breaks down the polynomial product into intermediate steps that are more manageable.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2b, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. It is known that 1, 169, and 481 are not correct. Ensure the properties of cyclotomic polynomials are applied correctly.

    **Improved subtask architecture:**
    Last sub-task architecture (COT-SC for sub-task 2) -&gt; (improve to) Reflexion for sub-task 2a and COT for sub-task 2b. Reflexion will help in refining the understanding and application of cyclotomic properties, while COT will ensure accurate multiplication.

    **Implementation:**
    The architecture will now involve Reflexion for handling the cyclotomic polynomial properties and COT for ensuring accurate multiplication of results. This should improve the accuracy and reliability of the outputs.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:** The current decomposition shows that Sub-task 1 is marked as &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that the decomposition is still not sufficient. This suggests that the task of calculating each term in the product is too complex for the current architecture. The suggestion indicates using properties of roots of unity or symmetry, which needs to be incorporated into the decomposition. Sub-task 2a and 2b are solvable, but the understanding of cyclotomic properties needs refinement.

**Completeness:** The sub-tasks are not fully complete as they do not adequately break down the initial complex expression into simpler, manageable parts. The critical information about simplifying the expression using symmetry or properties of roots of unity is missing from the sub-task instructions.

**Fitness:** The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The architecture needs to be revised to ensure that the sub-tasks are correctly decomposed and that the final response is accurate.

(2) **Improvement Suggestions:**
- **Further Decomposition:** The task should be further decomposed by explicitly using properties of roots of unity or symmetry to simplify the expressions. This will make the sub-tasks more manageable and ensure that the LLM can handle them.
- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Explicitly mention incorrect answers in the final sub-task to avoid common pitfalls. This should help in refining the final answer.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    Last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1a: Use properties of roots of unity to simplify the expression \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) for each \(k\). New sub-task 1b: Calculate the simplified expression for each \(k\) from 0 to 12. This decomposition breaks down the expression simplification into intermediate steps that are more manageable.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2b, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. It is known that 1, 169, 481, and 0 are not correct. Ensure the properties of cyclotomic polynomials are applied correctly.

    **Improved subtask architecture:**
    Last sub-task architecture (Reflexion for sub-task 2a) -&gt; (improve to) COT for sub-task 1a and Reflexion for sub-task 1b. COT will help in understanding the simplification process, while Reflexion will ensure accurate calculation of the simplified expressions.

    **Implementation:**
    The architecture will now involve COT for handling the simplification process and Reflexion for ensuring accurate calculation of results. This should improve the accuracy and reliability of the outputs.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing.

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:** The current architecture shows that Sub-task 3 is still incorrect, and Sub-task 1a has been marked as &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that further decomposition is needed. The suggestion from the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; output indicates that using properties of roots of unity or symmetry to simplify the expression should be considered, but this has not been effectively implemented. Sub-task 2b incorrectly calculates the product, and this error propagates to the final response.

**Completeness:** The sub-tasks do not include all necessary information from the original query. The critical information about the simplification and calculation of the expression using symmetry or properties of roots of unity is missing from the sub-task instructions. The connections between sub-tasks are not clearly stated, which affects the overall comprehension of the task.

**Fitness:** The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The architecture needs to be revised to ensure that the sub-tasks are correctly decomposed and that the final response is accurate.

(2) **Improvement Suggestions:**
- **Further Decomposition:** The task should be further decomposed by breaking down the expression simplification into more manageable steps that the LLM can handle. This will make the sub-tasks more manageable and ensure that the LLM can handle them.
- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Explicitly mention incorrect answers in the final sub-task to avoid common pitfalls. This should help in refining the final answer.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    Last sub-task 1a -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1a1: Identify the properties of roots of unity that can be used to simplify the expression \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). New sub-task 1a2: Apply these properties to simplify the expression for each \(k\). This decomposition breaks down the expression simplification into intermediate steps that are more manageable.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 2b, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. It is known that 1, 169, 481, and 0 are not correct. Ensure the properties of cyclotomic polynomials are applied correctly.

    **Improved subtask architecture:**
    Last sub-task architecture (COT for sub-task 1a) -&gt; (improve to) Reflexion for sub-task 1a1 and COT for sub-task 1a2. Reflexion will help in identifying the properties of roots of unity, while COT will ensure accurate application of these properties.

    **Implementation:**
    The architecture will now involve Reflexion for handling the identification of properties and COT for ensuring accurate application of results. This should improve the accuracy and reliability of the outputs.

A key property of roots of unity is that if \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, then \\( \\omega^{13} = 1 \\) and the sum of all 13th roots of unity is zero.

This means for any polynomial expression in \\( \\omega \\), we can reduce powers modulo 13 and use the fact that the sum of the 13th roots of unity is zero.; answer - The properties of roots of unity that can be used include: 1) \\( \\omega^{13} = 1 \\) and 2) the sum of all 13th roots of unity is zero.

Since omega is a 13th root of unity, omega^13 = 1. We can reduce powers of omega modulo 13. Also, the sum of all 13th roots of unity is zero. This allows us to express omega^k and omega^(2k) in terms of other roots of unity. Specifically, omega^(2k) = (omega^k)^2, and we can use the fact that omega^13 = 1 to simplify powers of omega. Additionally, we can express the expression as (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1, which might simplify further using these properties.; answer - The expression 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) can be rewritten as (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1, which simplifies using the properties of roots of unity.\nSub-task 1b output: thinking - The expression 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) can be rewritten using properties of roots of unity. Since omega is a 13th root of unity, omega^13 = 1. The expression simplifies to (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1. For k = 0 to 12, each term is non-zero and positive. Calculating the product of these terms directly involves complex roots of unity and cyclotomic polynomial properties.

Therefore, the entire product is 0 because multiplying by zero results in zero. This is a direct consequence of the fact that omega^0 = 1, which is one of the 13th roots of unity.; answer - 0\nSub-task 2b output: thinking - The result of sub-task 2a is 0 because the product includes a factor (1 - omega^0) = 0.

However, since omega^13 = 1, we can use the property that the product of all terms of the form (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is 0, because these are the differences of the roots of unity from 1. Therefore, the product \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - omega^k)^2 is also zero. Since the expression 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) = (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1, it never becomes zero, but it simplifies the problem considerably. Each term is positive and contributes a factor of 1 to the product, leaving us with a simplified calculation.; answer: The expression for each k is (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1.

Calculating the product of these terms directly involves complex roots of unity and cyclotomic polynomial properties. The product might be related to the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, and evaluating it at x = 2 could simplify the computation. However, direct calculation of the product modulo 1000 remains challenging due to the nature of roots of unity and requires deeper insight into polynomial evaluation.; answer: 0\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Evaluate the polynomial formed by these terms at x = 2 and use properties of cyclotomic polynomials to simplify the computation modulo 1000.\nCoT agent wGzs, on the purpose of calculating cyclotomic product, thinking: The product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is related to the 13th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at 1. The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, because it is the minimal polynomial for a primitive 13th root of unity over the rationals. The product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is the value of this polynomial at x = 1, which is 13. This is because the sum of all 13th roots of unity is 0, and (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) evaluated at x = 1 gives 13.; answer: 13\nCritic agent kFmo, on the purpose of refining cyclotomic product, thinking: The initial reasoning correctly identifies the use of the cyclotomic polynomial. However, the polynomial evaluated at x = 1 should be handled carefully. The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is indeed x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, and evaluating this at x = 1 yields 13. Thus, the product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is indeed 13.; answer: Yes, the calculation is correct. The product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is 13.\nCoT agent wGzs, on the purpose of refining cyclotomic product, thinking: The product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 can be calculated using the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, which is the minimal polynomial for a primitive 13th root of unity over the rationals. Evaluating this polynomial at x = 1 gives the sum of the coefficients, which is 13. This is because the sum of all 13th roots of unity is 0, and the polynomial (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) evaluated at x = 1 gives 13.; answer: 13\nCritic agent kFmo, on the purpose of refining cyclotomic product, thinking: The calculation of the product using cyclotomic polynomial properties is correct. The product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is indeed 13, as it corresponds to evaluating the 13th cyclotomic polynomial at x = 1.; answer: 13\nCoT agent wGzs, on the purpose of refining cyclotomic product, thinking: The product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is related to the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is the minimal polynomial of a primitive 13th root of unity. This polynomial is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, and evaluating this polynomial at x = 1 gives the sum of the coefficients, which is 13. This is a result of the fact that the sum of all 13th roots of unity is 0, and the polynomial (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) evaluated at x = 1 gives 13.; answer: 13\nCritic agent kFmo, on the purpose of refining cyclotomic product, thinking: The calculation of the product using cyclotomic polynomial properties is correct.; answer: 13\nCoT agent wGzs, on the purpose of refining cyclotomic product, thinking: The calculation of the product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 involves using the properties of the 13th cyclotomic polynomial.

Evaluating this polynomial at x = 1 gives the sum of the coefficients, which is 13. This result follows from the fact that the sum of all 13th roots of unity is 0, and the polynomial (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) evaluated at x = 1 gives 13.; answer: 13\nCritic agent kFmo, on the purpose of refining cyclotomic product, thinking: The calculation of the product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is incorrect as described. The sum of the coefficients of the 13th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at x = 1 is indeed 13, but this is not the product we are looking for. The product (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is actually 13, which is the value of the cyclotomic polynomial at x = 1, not the sum of coefficients.; answer: The product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is indeed 13, as it is the value of the 13th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at x = 1.\nCoT agent wGzs, on the purpose of refining cyclotomic product, thinking: The product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is related to the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is the minimal polynomial of a primitive 13th root of unity.

This is because the sum of all 13th roots of unity is 0, and the polynomial (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) evaluated at x = 1 gives 13. Therefore, the product is 13.; answer: 13\nCritic agent kFmo, on the purpose of refining cyclotomic product, thinking: The explanation correctly identifies the relationship between the product and the cyclotomic polynomial, but it does not directly address the product (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12. The product (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is actually 0, since (1 - omega^0) * (1 - omega^1) * ... * (1 - omega^12) includes the factor (1 - 1) = 0. Therefore, the product is 0, not 13.; answer: 0\nCoT agent wGzs, on the purpose of refining cyclotomic product, thinking: The product (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 includes the factor (1 - omega^0) = (1 - 1) = 0. Therefore, the entire product is 0 because multiplying by zero results in zero. This is a direct consequence of the fact that omega^0 = 1, which is one of the 13th roots of unity.; answer: 0\nCoT agent yjS2, on the purpose of squaring the cyclotomic product, thinking: The result of sub-task 2a is 0 because the product includes a factor (1 - omega^0) = 0. Squaring zero still results in zero, so the final product is 0.; answer: 0\nCoT agent qoF5, on the purpose of finding remainder, thinking: The product from sub-task 2b is 0, as it was determined that the product includes a factor that makes it zero. Therefore, when 0 is divided by any number, including 1000, the remainder is 0.; answer: 0&#34;]

final_reponse: [&#39;The product from sub-task 2b is 0, as it was determined that the product includes a factor that makes it zero. Therefore, when 0 is divided by any number, including 1000, the remainder is 0.\n\nAnswer:0&#39;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:** The sub-tasks are not entirely solvable as evidenced by the incorrect final response and low fitness scores. Sub-task 1b and Sub-task 2a explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that these tasks are too complex for the current decomposition and need further breakdown. The suggestions provided indicate a need to evaluate the polynomial at specific points and use cyclotomic polynomial properties, which have not been effectively addressed. Sub-task 3 also provides an incorrect result due to the propagation of errors from earlier tasks.

**Completeness:** The sub-tasks are not complete as they do not fully decompose the problem into simpler, manageable parts. Critical information about simplifying the expression using symmetry or properties of roots of unity is missing from the sub-task instructions. The connections between sub-tasks are not clearly stated, affecting the overall comprehension of the task.

**Fitness:** The fitness score remains at 0.0%, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The architecture needs to be revised to ensure that the sub-tasks are correctly decomposed and that the final response is accurate.

(2) **Improvement Suggestions:**
- **Further Decomposition:** The task should be further decomposed by breaking down the expression simplification into more manageable steps that the LLM can handle. This will make the sub-tasks more manageable and ensure that the LLM can handle them.
- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Explicitly mention incorrect answers in the final sub-task to avoid common pitfalls. This should help in refining the final answer.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    Last sub-task 1b -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1b1: Evaluate the polynomial formed by the terms at specific points using cyclotomic polynomial properties. New sub-task 1b2: Use the results from the evaluation to simplify the computation modulo 1000. This decomposition breaks down the polynomial evaluation into intermediate steps that are more manageable.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1b2, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. It is known that 1, 169, 481, and 0 are not correct. Ensure the properties of cyclotomic polynomials are applied correctly.

    **Improved subtask architecture:**
    Last sub-task architecture (COT for sub-task 1b) -&gt; (improve to) Reflexion for sub-task 1b1 and COT for sub-task 1b2. Reflexion will help in evaluating the polynomial at specific points, while COT will ensure accurate simplification of the computation.

    **Implementation:**
    The architecture will now involve Reflexion for handling the polynomial evaluation and COT for ensuring accurate simplification of results. This should improve the accuracy and reliability of the outputs.

sub_tasks: [&#39;Sub-task 1a1 output: thinking - To simplify the expression 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k), we can use properties of roots of unity. Since omega is a 13th root of unity, we know that omega^13 = 1 and the sum of all 13th roots of unity is 0. Additionally, omega^k * omega^(-k) = 1 for any integer k. These properties can help in simplifying expressions involving powers of omega.; answer - The expression 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) can be rewritten using the identity omega^(2k) = (omega^k)^2, and leveraging the fact that omega^13 = 1 to simplify powers of omega. The expression can also be related to (1 - omega^k)^2 by recognizing it as 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) = (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1.\nSub-task 1a2 output: thinking - We can simplify the expression 2 - 2*omega^k + omega^(2k) by recognizing it as (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1, as noted in the sub-task 1a1. Since omega^k is a 13th root of unity, we know omega^13 = 1, and omega^k can take any of the 13 values 1, omega, omega^2, ..., omega^12. The expression (1 - omega^k)^2 + 1 simplifies to 1 + (1 - omega^k)^2. This simplifies the product we need to calculate.; answer - The expression for each k simplifies to 1 + (1 - omega^k)^2.\nSub-task 1b1 output: thinking - We have the expression 1 + (1 - omega^k)^2 for each k, where omega is a 13th root of unity. We want to evaluate the product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + (1 - \\omega^k)^2) \\). This can be related to evaluating a polynomial at specific points. The polynomial that vanishes at all 13th roots of unity except 1 is the cyclotomic polynomial \\( \\Phi_{13}(x) \\). However, the expression is complicated by the specific form \\( 1 + (1 - \\omega^k)^2 \\). The product can be seen as evaluating a related polynomial at these roots. Since the roots are symmetric and sum to zero, this might simplify the product. However, the exact polynomial is not straightforward to determine from the given expression, and further decomposition or information might be needed to fully solve this.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider using properties of cyclotomic polynomials and symmetry of roots of unity to simplify the product further, or consider if there is a known result or technique for evaluating such expressions.\nSub-task 1b2 output: thinking - The product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\\omega^k+\\omega^{2k}) \\) can be simplified by recognizing that each term can be rewritten using the identity \\( 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = (1 - \\omega^k)^2 + 1 \\). This transformation suggests a relationship with cyclotomic polynomials, but the complexity of evaluating the product directly in terms of these polynomials or simplifying it modulo 1000 remains high. Given the complexity of the expression and lack of direct simplification methods, a deeper analysis or alternative approach might be needed to evaluate the product modulo 1000.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider decomposing the product into simpler expressions or using known results about products over roots of unity, possibly involving cyclotomic polynomials or symmetry arguments to reduce the complexity of the computation modulo 1000.\nSub-task 2a output: thinking - The product \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \\omega^k) \\) is related to the 13th cyclotomic polynomial \\( \\Phi_{13}(x) \\). The polynomial \\( \\Phi_{13}(x) \\) is defined as \\( \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \\omega^k) \\). Evaluating this polynomial at \\( x = 1 \\) gives \\( \\Phi_{13}(1) = 13 \\). This is because \\( \\omega \\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, and the cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at 1 results in 13. Therefore, the product of \\( (1 - \\omega^k) \\) for \\( k = 0 \\) to 12 is 13.; answer - 13\nSub-task 2b output: thinking - The result from sub-task 2a tells us that the product of (1 - omega^k) for k = 0 to 12 is 13. To find the final product for sub-task 2b, we need to square this result, as the sub-task 2b asks us to do so.; answer - 169\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The sub-task 2b result is 169. We need to find the remainder when 169 is divided by 1000. However, it is mentioned that 169 is not correct. This suggests there might be a misinterpretation or a mistake in the earlier steps. Since 169 is clearly a remainder when divided by 1000, the problem might require a deeper understanding or a different approach to the initial product calculation.; answer - 481&#39;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:** The architecture still struggles with solvability, as indicated by the incorrect answers and the presence of &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; in sub-tasks 1b1 and 1b2. This suggests that the decomposition is insufficient and the tasks remain too complex for the current architecture. The suggestions provided indicate a need to further break down the polynomial evaluation and use cyclotomic polynomial properties, which have not been effectively addressed. The incorrect final response indicates that errors from earlier tasks are propagating through the architecture.

**Completeness:** The sub-tasks do not fully capture the necessary steps to solve the original question. Critical information about simplifying the expression using symmetry or properties of roots of unity is missing from the sub-task instructions. The connections between sub-tasks are not clearly stated, affecting the overall comprehension of the task.

**Fitness:** The fitness score remains at 0.0%, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The architecture needs to be revised to ensure that the sub-tasks are correctly decomposed and that the final response is accurate.

(2) **Improvement Suggestions:**
- **Further Decomposition:** The task should be further decomposed by breaking down the polynomial evaluation into more manageable steps that the LLM can handle. This will make the sub-tasks more manageable and ensure that the LLM can handle them.
- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Explicitly mention incorrect answers in the final sub-task to avoid common pitfalls. This should help in refining the final answer.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    Last sub-task 1b1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1b1a: Break down the polynomial evaluation into smaller steps using known properties of cyclotomic polynomials. New sub-task 1b1b: Use symmetry and roots of unity properties to simplify the polynomial further. This decomposition breaks down the polynomial evaluation into intermediate steps that are more manageable.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1b1b, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. It is known that 1, 169, 481, and 0 are not correct. Ensure the properties of cyclotomic polynomials are applied correctly.

    **Improved subtask architecture:**
    Last sub-task architecture (Reflexion for sub-task 1b1) -&gt; (improve to) Reflexion for sub-task 1b1a and COT for sub-task 1b1b. Reflexion will help in breaking down the polynomial evaluation, while COT will ensure accurate application of symmetry and roots of unity properties.

    **Implementation:**
    The architecture will now involve Reflexion for handling the polynomial evaluation and COT for ensuring accurate application of results. This should improve the accuracy and reliability of the outputs.

A key property of roots of unity is that they are solutions to the equation x^n = 1. For the 13th roots of unity, we have omega^13 = 1, and the sum of all 13th roots of unity is zero. This can help in simplifying expressions involving powers of omega. Additionally, for any integer m, omega^m can be reduced to omega^(m mod 13) because omega^13 = 1.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:** The current architecture is not fully solvable, as indicated by the incorrect answers and the presence of &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; in sub-tasks 1b1 and 1b2. This suggests that the decomposition is insufficient, and the tasks remain too complex for the current architecture. The suggestions provided indicate a need to further break down the polynomial evaluation and use cyclotomic polynomial properties, which have not been effectively addressed. The incorrect final response indicates that errors from earlier tasks are propagating through the architecture.

**Completeness:** The sub-tasks do not fully capture the necessary steps to solve the original question. Critical information about simplifying the expression using symmetry or properties of roots of unity is missing from the sub-task instructions. The connections between sub-tasks are not clearly stated, affecting the overall comprehension of the task.

**Fitness:** The fitness score remains at 0.0%, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The architecture needs to be revised to ensure that the sub-tasks are correctly decomposed and that the final response is accurate.

(2) **Improvement Suggestions:**
- **Further Decomposition:** The task should be further decomposed by breaking down the polynomial evaluation into more manageable steps that the LLM can handle. This will make the sub-tasks more manageable and ensure that the LLM can handle them.
- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Explicitly mention incorrect answers in the final sub-task to avoid common pitfalls. This should help in refining the final answer.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    Last sub-task 1b1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1b1a: Break down the polynomial evaluation into smaller steps using known properties of cyclotomic polynomials. New sub-task 1b1b: Use symmetry and roots of unity properties to simplify the polynomial further. This decomposition breaks down the polynomial evaluation into intermediate steps that are more manageable.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1b1b, find the remainder when the product is divided by 1000. It is known that 1, 169, 481, 0, and 625 are not correct. Ensure the properties of cyclotomic polynomials are applied correctly.

    **Improved subtask architecture:**
    Last sub-task architecture (Reflexion for sub-task 1b1) -&gt; (improve to) Reflexion for sub-task 1b1a and COT for sub-task 1b1b. Reflexion will help in breaking down the polynomial evaluation, while COT will ensure accurate application of symmetry and roots of unity properties.

    **Implementation:**
    The architecture will now involve Reflexion for handling the polynomial evaluation and COT for ensuring accurate application of results. This should improve the accuracy and reliability of the outputs.
