Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \), where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity. Since \( \omega^{13} = 1 \) and \( \omega \neq 1 \), we know that \( \omega^k \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12 \) are the 13th roots of unity. We can rewrite each term in the product as \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + \omega^{2k} \). We notice that \( \omega^{2k} = \omega^{k} \cdot \omega^{k} = (\omega^k)^2 \), so the expression simplifies to \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + (\omega^k)^2 \). Now, let's consider the polynomial \( f(x) = x^{13} - 1 \), which has roots \( \omega^k \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12 \). We can express the product \( P \) as \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12}((1 - \omega^k)^2 + (\omega^k)^2) = \prod_{k=0}^{12}((1 - \omega^k)^2 + (\omega^k)^2) \). Now, consider the polynomial \( g(x) = (1-x)^2 + x^2 \). The roots of this polynomial are exactly the values of \( \omega^k \) that satisfy \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + (\omega^k)^2 = 0 \). Thus, the product \( P \) is equal to \( g(\omega^0) \cdot g(\omega^1) \cdot \ldots \cdot g(\omega^{12}) \). Since \( g(x) = (1-x)^2 + x^2 \), we can expand this to \( g(x) = 1 - 2x + x^2 + x^2 = 1 - 2x + 2x^2 \). Now, the product of the values of \( g(x) \) at the roots of unity is equivalent to evaluating the polynomial at these roots. This is a symmetric polynomial in the roots of unity, and its value can be found by considering the properties of the roots of unity. Since the 13th roots of unity satisfy \( x^{13} - 1 = 0 \), we have \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} \omega^k = 1 \). Therefore, the product \( P \) simplifies to \( P = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - 2\omega^k + 2(\omega^k)^2) = g(1)^{13} \). Evaluating \( g(1) = (1-1)^2 + 1^2 = 1 \), we find that \( P = 1^{13} = 1 \). Thus, the remainder when \( P \) is divided by 1000 is 1.

Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity. We know that \( \omega^k \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12 \) are all the 13th roots of unity. We can simplify the expression inside the product: \( 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \). Thus, the expression becomes \( (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1 \). We need to evaluate the product of these terms for \( k = 0 \) to 12. Notice that the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 \) can be factored as \( (x - 1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) \). The roots of \( x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0 \) are precisely \( \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12} \). Thus, the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 \). We need to evaluate this product at the specific value of \( x = 2 - \omega^k \). This problem is symmetric and related to cyclotomic polynomials, but the specific product simplifies due to symmetry and the properties of roots of unity. The product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \) is actually related to evaluating a cyclotomic polynomial at a specific point, and by symmetry and properties of roots of unity, this evaluates to \( 13^2 \). Therefore, the product simplifies to 169. We then find the remainder when 169 is divided by 1000, which is simply 169 itself since 169 < 1000.

Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
proposed answer: To solve this problem, we note that \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity, meaning \( \omega^{13} = 1 \) and \( \omega^k \neq 1 \) for \( 1 \leq k \leq 12 \). We need to evaluate the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \).

First, simplify the expression inside the product:
\[ 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1. \]

The expression \((1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1\) can be further simplified by considering properties of roots of unity. Notice that since \( \omega^k \) are roots of unity, \( 1 - \omega^k \) are roots of the polynomial \( 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^{12} = 0 \), except for \( x = 1 \).

Thus, the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{12} (1 - \omega^k) \) is the value of the polynomial evaluated at 1, which is 13 (since it is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at 1).

We need to evaluate the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \), which can be seen as evaluating the polynomial \( f(x) = (2 - 2x + x^2) \) at each root of unity \( \omega^k \).

The polynomial \( f(x) = (2 - 2x + x^2) \) can be rewritten as \( f(x) = (1-x)^2 + 1 \), and we are evaluating it at the 13th roots of unity.

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is symmetric and has a nice property when evaluated at roots of unity:
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\omega^k) = f(1) \prod_{k=1}^{12} f(\omega^k) = f(1) \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12} ((1-\omega^k)^2 + 1). \]

Since \( f(1) = 1 \), we essentially need to evaluate:
\[ \prod_{k=1}^{12} ((1-\omega^k)^2 + 1). \]

Using the fact that \( \omega^k \) are roots of unity, we find that \( (1-\omega^k)^2 + 1 \) simplifies to \( 2 \) for each \( k \), since:
\[ (1-\omega^k)^2 + 1 = 1 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} + 1 = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}. \]

Thus, the product becomes:
\[ \prod_{k=1}^{12} 2 = 2^{12}. \]

Now, calculate \( 2^{12} \):
\[ 2^{12} = 4096. \]

Finally, find the remainder of 4096 when divided by 1000:
\[ 4096 \equiv 96 \pmod{1000}. \]

Therefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 96.

Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
proposed answer: The expression inside the product can be simplified to (1 - ω^k)^2 + 1. The product over all 13th roots of unity except 1 is related to the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_{13}(1), which is 13. Thus, the product simplifies to 13^{12}. Calculating the remainder of 13^{12} modulo 1000 involves using successive squaring: 13^2 = 169, 13^4 = 169^2 = 28561 ≡ 561 (mod 1000), 13^8 = 561^2 = 314721 ≡ 721 (mod 1000), and 13^{12} = 721 × 561 ≡ 481 (mod 1000).

Question: Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.
proposed answer: The product calculated in sub-task 2b is 169, but the remainder of 169 when divided by 1000 is 169, which is not correct according to the given information. Since 1, 169, 481, and 0 are not correct, the correct remainder must be another number. I suspect there might be a calculation error in the earlier sub-tasks, as the product of the terms involving roots of unity should be treated carefully. Given that the remainder must be different from the ones listed, and without the detailed calculations, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact error or compute the correct remainder.
