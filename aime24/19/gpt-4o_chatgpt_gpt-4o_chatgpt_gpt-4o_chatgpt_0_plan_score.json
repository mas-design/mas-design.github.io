    "thinking": "Answer ID 1 provides a clear and correct explanation of the problem. It correctly simplifies the expression inside the product to \\((1 - \\omega^k)^2 + 1\\) and uses the properties of cyclotomic polynomials to determine the value of the product. The answer correctly concludes that the product is 169 and provides the remainder when divided by 1000, which is also 169. \n\nAnswer ID 4 is similar to Answer ID 1 in reasoning and also arrives at the correct answer of 169. It uses the properties of roots of unity and cyclotomic polynomials to correctly determine the product and remainder.\n\nAnswer ID 6, although it eventually arrives at the correct answer of 169, contains some inconsistencies in the explanation. The reasoning is less clear, and there is a mention of a misunderstanding or error, which creates confusion.\n\nAnswer ID 0 incorrectly concludes that the product is 1 by misapplying the polynomial evaluation at the roots of unity. The simplification and final result are incorrect.\n\nAnswer ID 2 incorrectly simplifies the product to \\(2^{12}\\) and calculates the remainder as 96. This is incorrect due to the improper simplification of the product.\n\nAnswer ID 3 incorrectly calculates the product as \\(13^{12}\\) and finds the remainder as 481. This is incorrect because the product should be \\(13^2\\), not \\(13^{12}\\).\n\nAnswer ID 5 incorrectly claims that the product is zero due to a zero term from \\(k=0\\). This is incorrect because the term for \\(k=0\\) does not make the entire product zero. The correct simplification shows the product is non-zero.",
