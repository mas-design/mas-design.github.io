    <pre>To solve this problem, we note that \( \omega \) is a 13th root of unity, meaning \( \omega^{13} = 1 \) and \( \omega^k \neq 1 \) for \( 1 \leq k \leq 12 \). We need to evaluate the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \).

First, simplify the expression inside the product:
\[ 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1. \]

The expression \((1 - \omega^k)^2 + 1\) can be further simplified by considering properties of roots of unity. Notice that since \( \omega^k \) are roots of unity, \( 1 - \omega^k \) are roots of the polynomial \( 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^{12} = 0 \), except for \( x = 1 \).

Thus, the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{12} (1 - \omega^k) \) is the value of the polynomial evaluated at 1, which is 13 (since it is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at 1).

We need to evaluate the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) \), which can be seen as evaluating the polynomial \( f(x) = (2 - 2x + x^2) \) at each root of unity \( \omega^k \).

The polynomial \( f(x) = (2 - 2x + x^2) \) can be rewritten as \( f(x) = (1-x)^2 + 1 \), and we are evaluating it at the 13th roots of unity.

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is symmetric and has a nice property when evaluated at roots of unity:
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\omega^k) = f(1) \prod_{k=1}^{12} f(\omega^k) = f(1) \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12} ((1-\omega^k)^2 + 1). \]

Since \( f(1) = 1 \), we essentially need to evaluate:
\[ \prod_{k=1}^{12} ((1-\omega^k)^2 + 1). \]

Using the fact that \( \omega^k \) are roots of unity, we find that \( (1-\omega^k)^2 + 1 \) simplifies to \( 2 \) for each \( k \), since:
\[ (1-\omega^k)^2 + 1 = 1 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} + 1 = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}. \]

Thus, the product becomes:
\[ \prod_{k=1}^{12} 2 = 2^{12}. \]

Now, calculate \( 2^{12} \):
\[ 2^{12} = 4096. \]

Finally, find the remainder of 4096 when divided by 1000:
\[ 4096 \equiv 96 \pmod{1000}. \]

Therefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 96.
