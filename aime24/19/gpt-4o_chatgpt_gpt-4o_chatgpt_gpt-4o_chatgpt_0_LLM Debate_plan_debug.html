    <pre>Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.

### thinking by Debate Agent xgiN:
The expression inside the product can be simplified to (1 - ω^k)^2 + 1. The product over all 13th roots of unity except 1 is related to the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_{13}(1), which is 13. Thus, the product simplifies to 13^{12}. Calculating the remainder of 13^{12} modulo 1000 involves using successive squaring: 13^2 = 169, 13^4 = 169^2 = 28561 ≡ 561 (mod 1000), 13^8 = 561^2 = 314721 ≡ 721 (mod 1000), and 13^{12} = 721 × 561 ≡ 481 (mod 1000).

### thinking by Debate Agent tSIZ:
The expression can be rewritten using properties of roots of unity. Specifically, the expression inside the product can be simplified as (1 - ω^k)^2. The product of these expressions, over all 13th roots of unity except 1, relates to the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_{13}(1), which is 13. Therefore, the product simplifies to 13^{12}. To find the remainder of 13^{12} modulo 1000, we use repeated squaring and modular arithmetic. Calculating 13^2 = 169, 13^4 = 561, 13^8 = 721, and finally 13^{12} = 721 * 561 = 481 modulo 1000.
