    <pre>We are given that the circumradius R is 13 and the inradius r is 6. We also know that IA is perpendicular to OI, which implies that triangle ABC is a right triangle. This is because the condition IA \perp OI is equivalent to the fact that the triangle is right-angled. In a right triangle, the circumradius R is equal to half the hypotenuse. Since R = 13, the hypotenuse of triangle ABC is 26. We can use the formula for the inradius of a right triangle, which is r = (a + b - c) / 2, where c is the hypotenuse, and a and b are the other two sides. We have r = 6 and c = 26, so 6 = (a + b - 26) / 2. Solving for a + b, we get a + b = 38. Now, we use the fact that the area of the triangle can also be expressed as K = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. The semiperimeter s is (a + b + c) / 2 = (38 + 26) / 2 = 32. Thus, K = r * s = 6 * 32 = 192. The area K is also given by the formula K = (1/2) * a * b for a right triangle. Therefore, (1/2) * a * b = 192, so a * b = 384. We need to find AB * AC, which is a * b, so the answer is 384.
