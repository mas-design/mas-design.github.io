    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.

**Decomposition:**
To solve the given problem, we need to break it down into manageable sub-tasks that can be addressed using the existing architectures in the archive. The problem involves geometric properties of a triangle with given circumradius and inradius, and a perpendicularity condition between the incenter and circumcenter.

1. **Sub-task 1:** Calculate the area of triangle $\triangle ABC$ using the given circumradius $R = 13$ and inradius $r = 6$. The area can be found using the formula $A = r 	imes s$, where $s$ is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

2. **Sub-task 2:** Determine the semi-perimeter $s$ of the triangle using the relationship between the circumradius, inradius, and the area obtained from Sub-task 1.

3. **Sub-task 3:** Calculate $AB \cdot AC$ using the relationship between the side lengths, the semi-perimeter, and the area. This involves using the formula $A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the side lengths of the triangle. Additionally, use the given condition $\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}$ to simplify the calculations.

By decomposing the problem into these sub-tasks, we ensure that each sub-task is solvable by the given agents in the archive. The sub-tasks are designed to progressively build upon each other, leading to the final solution of finding $AB \cdot AC$.

**Overall Architecture:**
To address each of these sub-tasks, we will use a combination of the existing architectures in the archive. The architecture will be structured in a multi-layered manner to ensure that each sub-task is addressed effectively.

1. **Layer 1:** Use the &#39;Chain-of-Thought&#39; (CoT) architecture to address Sub-task 1. This will allow the model to think step by step to calculate the area of the triangle.

2. **Layer 2:** Use the &#39;Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought&#39; (CoT-SC) architecture to address Sub-task 2. This will allow for varied reasoning paths to determine the semi-perimeter and ensure consistency in the solution.

3. **Layer 3:** Use the &#39;Self-Refine (Reflexion)&#39; architecture to address Sub-task 3. This will enable iterative refinement of the calculation of $AB \cdot AC$, leveraging feedback to improve the solution.

**Implementation:**
The implementation involves setting up the layers and connections between the blocks to ensure smooth information flow and effective problem-solving.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula A = r * s, where r is the inradius and s is the semi-perimeter. Since we know the inradius r = 6, we can express the area A in terms of the semi-perimeter s. However, without additional information about the side lengths or the semi-perimeter, we cannot determine the exact area or the semi-perimeter directly. The problem might require using other properties or relationships involving the circumradius, inradius, and the given perpendicular condition to find s or to relate it to AB and AC.; answer - 78s\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide additional relationships or properties to find the semi-perimeter s or relate it to the side lengths.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From Sub-task 1, we have the area A of the triangle in terms of the semi-perimeter s as A = 78s. However, without additional information, we cannot directly determine s. We need to use other properties or relationships involving the circumradius, inradius, and the perpendicular condition to solve for s.; answer - 78\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide additional relationships or properties to find the semi-perimeter s or relate it to the side lengths.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The problem involves a geometric condition where the incenter I and circumcenter O have IA perpendicular to OI. This suggests a special relationship between the triangle&#39;s sides, inradius, and circumradius. Given R = 13 and r = 6, there might be a known theorem or property that applies here, such as properties of isosceles triangles or specific configurations. The perpendicularity condition implies a specific geometric configuration that hasn&#39;t been fully utilized. Without more information or a known theorem that directly applies, the problem seems underdetermined. The condition might imply a specific type of triangle, such as a right triangle or an isosceles triangle, but without further geometric insight or a specific theorem, the calculation of AB * AC is challenging. The perpendicularity condition suggests the triangle might have special properties that relate the sides to the given radii, but this has not been fully explored in previous attempts. Without additional geometric insights or known theorems, the problem remains difficult to solve directly.; answer - 78\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Explore the geometric implications of the condition \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} to find a relationship between the sides AB, AC, and the given radii. Consider if the triangle is isosceles or equilateral, or if there is a known theorem that applies to this configuration.&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent TaBR, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula A = r * s, where r is the inradius and s is the semi-perimeter. Since we know the inradius r = 6, we can express the area A in terms of the semi-perimeter s. However, without additional information about the side lengths or the semi-perimeter, we cannot determine the exact area or the semi-perimeter directly. The problem might require using other properties or relationships involving the circumradius, inradius, and the given perpendicular condition to find s or to relate it to AB and AC.; answer: 78s\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide additional relationships or properties to find the semi-perimeter s or relate it to the side lengths.\nCoT-SC agent Gky2, on the purpose of determining semi-perimeter, thinking: The area of the triangle is given as 78s from Sub-task 1, where s is the semi-perimeter. The area can also be expressed as A = r * s = 6s. Equating these two expressions for the area, we have 78s = 6s. Solving for s would give us the semi-perimeter. However, this seems incorrect as it suggests s = 0, which is not possible. There might be a misunderstanding or additional relationships needed to find s correctly.; answer: 0\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the relationships or provide additional properties to correctly determine the semi-perimeter s, as current calculations suggest an impossible result.\nCoT-SC agent I0Tf, on the purpose of determining semi-perimeter, thinking: To find the semi-perimeter s, we can use the given area formula A = r * s, where A is the area of the triangle and r is the inradius. From the sub-task 1, the area is expressed as 78s. However, without knowing the actual area or additional relationships, we cannot directly find s. The problem requires additional information or properties to relate s to known quantities like the circumradius or the side lengths.; answer: 78\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide additional relationships or properties to find the semi-perimeter s or relate it to the side lengths.\nCoT-SC agent M8oc, on the purpose of determining semi-perimeter, thinking: From Sub-task 1, we have the area A = 78s, where s is the semi-perimeter. However, to find s directly, we need more information. Typically, the area can also be expressed using the formula A = r * s, where r is the inradius, so A = 6s. Equating the two expressions for the area, we get 78s = 6s. This seems incorrect, suggesting a mistake in the initial setup or missing information to find s directly.; answer: 13\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Verify the relationship between the given area expression and the semi-perimeter, or provide additional conditions or properties to accurately determine s.\nCoT-SC agent hzYH, on the purpose of determining semi-perimeter, thinking: From Sub-task 1, we have the area A of the triangle in terms of the semi-perimeter s as A = 78s. However, without additional information, we cannot directly determine s. We need to use other properties or relationships involving the circumradius, inradius, and the perpendicular condition to solve for s.; answer: 78\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide additional relationships or properties to find the semi-perimeter s or relate it to the side lengths.\nCoT-SC agent N6Mw, on the purpose of determining semi-perimeter, thinking: In sub-task 1, we found that the area of the triangle is expressed as 78s, where s is the semi-perimeter. To find the semi-perimeter s, we need to relate it to other known values or properties of the triangle. We know the area can also be expressed as A = r * s = 6 * s. Therefore, 78s = 6s, which seems incorrect. The area should be calculated as A = r * s = 6s, but we need the actual area value to find s. Without additional information, such as the side lengths or another way to determine the area, we cannot solve for s directly. The perpendicular condition might provide additional geometric relationships, but those are not currently detailed in the sub-tasks.; answer: 78s\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide additional relationships or properties to determine the exact area or relate the semi-perimeter s to known values such as side lengths or use the perpendicular condition to derive additional equations.\nCoT agent EGne, on the purpose of calculating AB \\cdot AC, thinking: To find AB \\cdot AC, we need to use the relationship between the circumradius R, inradius r, and the perpendicular condition \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI}. The condition \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} implies that the A-excircle is tangent to the circumcircle at A, which gives us a special configuration. However, without explicit values for the side lengths or additional properties, it&#39;s challenging to directly find AB \\cdot AC. The formula A = r \\times s, where A is the area of the triangle, can be used to find the semi-perimeter s if the area A is known. The given circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6 suggest a relationship involving the area, but additional properties or relationships are needed to find the exact value of AB \\cdot AC.; answer: 78\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide more geometric properties or relationships involving the condition \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} to find AB \\cdot AC.\nCritic agent eNpf, on the purpose of reviewing AB \\cdot AC calculation, thinking: The answer provided is 78, but there is no clear justification or derivation for this value given the conditions of the problem. The perpendicular condition \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} suggests a special geometric configuration, possibly involving the excircle or other properties, but this was not fully explored. Without a clear derivation or additional geometric insights, the answer of 78 seems arbitrary. The suggestion to provide more geometric properties or relationships is valid, as the problem seems underdetermined with the given information.; answer: False\nCoT agent EGne, on the purpose of refining AB \\cdot AC calculation, thinking: The problem involves a geometric condition where the incenter I and circumcenter O have IA perpendicular to OI. This suggests a special configuration, possibly involving the excircle or other properties. The circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6 are given, but the relationship between these and the sides AB, AC is not straightforward. The area A = r * s can help find the semi-perimeter s if the area A is known. However, the perpendicular condition suggests a deeper geometric relationship that is not fully explored here. Without additional geometric insights or relationships, the problem remains underdetermined.; answer: 78\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide more geometric properties or relationships involving the condition \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} to find AB \\cdot AC.\nCritic agent eNpf, on the purpose of reviewing AB \\cdot AC calculation, thinking: The reasoning does not fully utilize the given condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\).

The answer of 78 is given without clear justification or derivation based on the problem&#39;s conditions.; answer: The answer of 78 is not justified by the reasoning provided. The problem might involve using the condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) to find a specific relationship between the triangle&#39;s sides and its inradius and circumradius.\nCoT agent EGne, on the purpose of refining AB \\cdot AC calculation, thinking: The problem involves a special geometric condition where the incenter I and circumcenter O have IA perpendicular to OI. This suggests a specific configuration that relates the sides of the triangle to its inradius and circumradius. The given circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6 provide constraints, but the perpendicular condition is key to solving the problem. The perpendicularity implies a specific relationship between the incenter, circumcenter, and the triangle&#39;s sides, possibly involving the excircle or other geometric properties. However, without explicitly using this relationship or additional geometric insights, the problem remains difficult to solve directly.

This perpendicularity suggests a specific relationship between the incenter, circumcenter, and the sides of the triangle that needs to be explored. The problem requires using this condition along with the given radii to find a relationship between the sides \\( AB \\), \\( AC \\), and the circumradius and inradius.; answer: False\nCoT agent EGne, on the purpose of refining AB \\cdot AC calculation, thinking: The problem involves a special geometric condition where the incenter I and circumcenter O have IA perpendicular to OI.

The reasoning does not fully utilize the geometric condition IA perpendicular to OI, which is a key aspect of the problem. This condition suggests a specific relationship between the inradius, circumradius, and the triangle&#39;s sides, likely involving the Euler line or a special configuration like a right triangle or an isosceles triangle. The answer should consider known geometric theorems or properties that relate these elements, such as the relationship between the inradius, circumradius, and the product of the sides in certain triangle configurations.; answer: The problem is complex due to the specific geometric condition and lack of direct theorems that seem to apply.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable**: The sub-tasks are not solvable as indicated by the presence of `&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;` in the answers. This suggests the need for further decomposition. The suggestions provided indicate that additional geometric relationships or properties need to be explored. The sub-tasks were too general and did not provide enough guidance or information for the agents to solve them effectively. This is a case of (a) decomposition issue, as the tasks were too broad and lacked specificity.

(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not cover all necessary information. While they mention the inradius, circumradius, and perpendicularity condition, they fail to leverage these in a way that leads to a solvable problem. The connections between sub-tasks were not clearly established, leading to a lack of necessary information flow.

(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score is low, indicating the final answer is incorrect. This is due to the lack of effective decomposition and the inability of the current architecture to solve the sub-tasks. The final response remains the same incorrect answer as before, suggesting the need for updated instructions to avoid known wrong answers.

(2) Improvements: The implementation should be revised to include more detailed and specific sub-task instructions. The sub-tasks need to be decomposed further to make them solvable by the agents. Additionally, the final sub-task should be updated with instructions to avoid known incorrect answers, based on the memory of past incorrect responses.

thought: 
(1) **Further Decomposition**: The previous sub-task 1 was to calculate the area of the triangle using the circumradius and inradius, which was too broad. We can decompose it further as follows:

- Last sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2: Calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter found in sub-task 1 and verify its consistency with the given circumradius.

- Last sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 3: Use the perpendicularity condition and any known geometric theorems to find AB * AC, ensuring to avoid known incorrect answers.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We know the area A of triangle ABC can be expressed as A = r * s, where r is the inradius and s is the semi-perimeter. Given that the inradius r = 6, we can express the area A as A = 6s. However, we do not have the area A directly given, nor do we have enough information to calculate it directly from the circumradius and inradius alone without additional properties of the triangle or side lengths. Therefore, we cannot calculate s directly from the information given.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: To find the semi-perimeter s, we need more information such as the area of the triangle or the side lengths. Alternatively, if there is a known relationship involving the circumradius, inradius, and semi-perimeter that can be applied, that might help.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To find the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter, we need the semi-perimeter itself, which we could not determine directly from the given information. The circumradius and inradius alone do not provide enough information to calculate the semi-perimeter or the area directly. We need additional relationships or properties, such as side lengths or another formula that relates the circumradius, inradius, and semi-perimeter. Without this, calculating the area is not possible from the information given.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: We need additional relationships or properties involving the circumradius, inradius, and semi-perimeter, such as side lengths or another formula that can help us find the semi-perimeter or area.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We have a triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, given circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) is crucial. This condition is a known property of certain triangles, specifically right triangles, where the incenter lies on the altitude from the hypotenuse. However, in this problem, it suggests a special relationship between the sides. Using the formula \\( R = \\frac{abc}{4K} \\) and \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\), where K is the area, we relate the circumradius and inradius to the sides. Additionally, the formula \\( R = \\frac{abc}{4K} \\) and \\( r = \\frac{K}{s} \\) give us relationships involving the sides a, b, c, and semi-perimeter s. With \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) and Euler&#39;s relation \\( OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \\), the perpendicularity condition suggests a specific geometrical configuration that can be exploited. The perpendicularity condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that the triangle might have a special configuration such as being isosceles or having a specific angle measure that can be exploited. Using known results for such configurations, we can deduce the product AB * AC using the given circumradius and inradius. The perpendicularity condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) suggests a specific configuration, and using the known result for this configuration, we find \\( AB \\cdot AC = c^2 = 2Rr = 2 \\times 13 \\times 6 = 156 \\).; answer - 156&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent mKLu, on the purpose of calculating semi-perimeter, thinking: We know the area A of triangle ABC can be expressed as A = r * s, where r is the inradius and s is the semi-perimeter.

We need additional relationships or properties, such as side lengths or another formula that relates the circumradius, inradius, and semi-perimeter.

Without the semi-perimeter, we cannot directly verify the area with the circumradius. The problem might involve specific relationships or additional properties of the triangle that are not immediately apparent, such as using known formulas connecting inradius, circumradius, and semi-perimeter in specific triangle configurations.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Investigate if there are specific triangle identities or formulas involving the circumradius, inradius, and the perpendicular condition given (\\overline{IA}\\perp\\overline{OI}) that could help in determining the semi-perimeter or area.\nCoT-SC agent LPT0, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: To calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter, we need to know the semi-perimeter &#39;s&#39;. However, as noted in Sub-task 1, we do not have enough information to directly calculate &#39;s&#39; without the side lengths or the area. Additionally, we need a relationship that involves the circumradius, inradius, and possibly the semi-perimeter. One such relationship is Euler&#39;s inequality for triangles: R &gt;= 2r, where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. However, this does not directly help us find the area or the semi-perimeter. Without additional information, such as side lengths or a direct formula involving these radii and the semi-perimeter, we cannot proceed further with calculating the area or verifying consistency with the circumradius.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: We need more information, such as side lengths, the area, or a specific relationship involving the circumradius, inradius, and semi-perimeter, to proceed with calculating the area or verifying its consistency with the circumradius.\nCoT-SC agent H9yt, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: We are asked to calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter, but in the previous sub-task, we found that the semi-perimeter cannot be determined directly from the given information. We need either the area of the triangle or the side lengths to calculate the semi-perimeter. Alternatively, we could use a known relationship involving the circumradius (R), inradius (r), and the semi-perimeter (s). One such relationship is the formula A = r * s for the area, and A can also be expressed using the circumradius as A = abc / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. However, without knowing the sides or area directly, we cannot compute s or verify the area. The task is too complex without additional information or assumptions.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: To proceed, we need either the area of the triangle or the side lengths. Alternatively, a known relationship involving the circumradius, inradius, and semi-perimeter might help, but without more information, the task remains complex.\nCoT-SC agent gZxo, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: The problem involves finding the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter and verifying it with the circumradius. However, we do not have the semi-perimeter directly, nor do we have the side lengths or area directly given. The given information about the inradius and circumradius, along with the perpendicularity condition, suggests a special property or relationship might be used, but without additional information or a known formula that directly relates these quantities, it is difficult to proceed. Typically, the area could be found if we had the side lengths or another relationship, but with the given data, this is challenging.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: To find the area of the triangle, we need either the side lengths or a specific relationship involving the circumradius, inradius, and area. Alternatively, a known formula or identity specific to the configuration given (such as a relationship involving IA ⊥ OI) might be helpful.\nCoT agent qp0o, on the purpose of calculating AB * AC, thinking: We have a triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, given circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) is crucial. This condition is a known property of certain triangles, specifically right triangles, where the incenter lies on the altitude from the hypotenuse. However, in this problem, it suggests a special relationship between the sides.

Using known results for such configurations, we can deduce the product AB * AC using the given circumradius and inradius. The perpendicularity condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) suggests a specific configuration, and using the known result for this configuration, we find \\( AB \\cdot AC = c^2 = 2Rr = 2 \\times 13 \\times 6 = 156 \\).; answer: 156\nCritic agent p1pN, on the purpose of reviewing AB * AC calculation, thinking: The answer seems correct based on the given conditions and the use of the perpendicularity condition. The reasoning involves using known geometric relationships and properties of the triangle, such as Euler&#39;s relation and the perpendicularity condition, to arrive at the product AB * AC. The calculation 2Rr = 2 * 13 * 6 = 156 is consistent with the known result for this configuration.; answer: True&#34;]

final_reponse: [&#34;We have a triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I, given circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6. The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) is crucial.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable**: The sub-tasks are not solvable as indicated by the presence of `&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;` in the answers, especially for Sub-task 1 and Sub-task 2. This indicates that the tasks need further decomposition. The suggestions provided indicate that additional geometric relationships or properties need to be explored. This is a case of (a) decomposition issue, as the tasks were too broad and lacked specificity.

(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not cover all necessary information. While they mention the inradius, circumradius, and perpendicularity condition, they fail to leverage these in a way that leads to a solvable problem. The connections between sub-tasks were not clearly established, leading to a lack of necessary information flow.

(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score is low, indicating the final answer is incorrect. This is due to the lack of effective decomposition and the inability of the current architecture to solve the sub-tasks. The final response remains the same incorrect answer as before, suggesting the need for updated instructions to avoid known wrong answers.

(2) Improvements: The implementation should be revised to include more detailed and specific sub-task instructions. The sub-tasks need to be decomposed further to make them solvable by the agents. Additionally, the final sub-task should be updated with instructions to avoid known incorrect answers, based on the memory of past incorrect responses.

thought: 
(1) **Further Decomposition**: The previous sub-task 1 was to calculate the area of the triangle using the circumradius and inradius, which was too broad. We can decompose it further as follows:

- Last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1: Calculate the semi-perimeter s using the formula A = r * s and the given inradius r = 6. Provide any necessary assumptions or relationships based on the triangle&#39;s properties.

- Last sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2: Calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter found in sub-task 1 and verify its consistency with the given circumradius.

- Last sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 3: Use the perpendicularity condition and any known geometric theorems to find AB * AC, ensuring to avoid known incorrect answers.

These new sub-tasks are more specific and provide a clearer path to solving the problem, ensuring that each step builds on the previous one.

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**: The final sub-task should include instructions to avoid known incorrect answers. For example, &#34;It is known that 78 is not correct.&#34; This will help guide the agents to explore alternative solutions and avoid repeating past mistakes.

We are given the inradius r = 6. However, we need the area A to find s. To find the area, we could use Heron&#39;s formula if we had the side lengths, or use another method if more information is available. Since the problem states IA ⊥ OI, there might be a special property of the triangle that could relate the circumradius, inradius, and side lengths, but without additional information or assumptions, it&#39;s challenging to find s directly.; answer - 78\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide additional information about the triangle&#39;s side lengths or another relationship that can be used to find the area A directly.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Given that the semi-perimeter s is 78, we can calculate the area A of the triangle using the formula A = r * s, where r is the inradius. Since r = 6, the area A = 6 * 78 = 468. To verify the consistency of this area with the given circumradius, we use the formula A = abc / (4R), where R is the circumradius. However, we do not have the side lengths a, b, and c, so we cannot directly verify this. The problem might have a special property due to IA ⊥ OI, but without additional relationships or side lengths, verification is challenging.; answer - 468\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide side lengths or another relationship to verify the area with the circumradius directly.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The previous attempts did not correctly utilize the information that IA ⊥ OI implies a special property of the triangle. This is a key hint that the triangle is right-angled at A. For a right triangle with circumradius R and inradius r, there is a known relationship AB * AC = 4Rr. Given R = 13 and r = 6, we can use this formula to find AB * AC directly.; answer - 312&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent vGkn, on the purpose of calculating semi-perimeter, thinking: To find the semi-perimeter s, we use the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of the inradius and the semi-perimeter: A = r * s.

Since r = 6, the area A = 6 * 78 = 468. To verify the consistency of this area with the given circumradius, we use the formula A = abc / (4R), where R is the circumradius. However, we do not have the side lengths a, b, and c, so we cannot directly verify this. The problem might have a special property due to IA ⊥ OI, but without additional relationships or side lengths, verification is challenging.; answer: 468\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide side lengths or another relationship to verify the area with the circumradius directly.\nCoT-SC agent khth, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: We are given that the semi-perimeter s is 78 from the previous sub-task. The area of the triangle can be calculated using A = r * s, where r is the inradius. With r = 6 and s = 78, the area A = 6 * 78 = 468. To verify consistency with the circumradius, we can use the formula A = abc / (4R), where R is the circumradius and abc is the product of the side lengths. With R = 13, we have 468 = abc / 52, so abc = 468 * 52 = 24336. The product AB * AC should be consistent with this calculation.; answer: 468\nCoT-SC agent 9vMu, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: To calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter, we need to verify consistency with the given circumradius. We have the circumradius R = 13 and the semi-perimeter s = 78. The area A can be calculated using A = r * s, where r is the inradius, which is 6. Therefore, A = 6 * 78 = 468. We can also check the consistency using the formula A = abc / (4R), where a, b, c are the side lengths and R is the circumradius. However, without the specific side lengths, we cannot directly verify this consistency. Given the circumradius and inradius, we can explore relationships like Euler&#39;s inequality or specific triangle properties, but without additional side length information, a direct verification is challenging.; answer: 468\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide side length information or relationships that allow calculation of abc for direct consistency verification with circumradius.\nCoT-SC agent pYCz, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: To calculate the area of the triangle, we need to use the semi-perimeter s, which was given as 78 in Sub-task 1. The area A can be found using A = r * s, where r is the inradius, given as 6. Therefore, A = 6 * 78. We should verify this area is consistent with the given circumradius R = 13 using the formula A = abc / (4R), where a, b, c are the side lengths. However, without the side lengths, we cannot verify this directly. The problem might need more information or assumptions about the triangle&#39;s properties to find side lengths or verify consistency.; answer: 468\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide side lengths or another relationship to verify area consistency with the circumradius.\nCoT-SC agent m2EH, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: To calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter, we need to verify the consistency with the given circumradius. From Sub-task 1, we have the semi-perimeter s = 78. The area A can be calculated using the formula A = r * s, where r is the inradius. Given r = 6, the area A = 6 * 78 = 468. To verify the consistency with the circumradius, we use the formula A = abc / (4R), where R is the circumradius and abc is the product of the side lengths. Since we do not have the side lengths directly, we cannot verify this consistency without additional information or assumptions about the side lengths or another relationship that can be used to find the area directly.; answer: 468\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide additional information about the triangle&#39;s side lengths or another relationship that can be used to verify the consistency of the area with the given circumradius.\nCoT agent vib8, on the purpose of calculating AB * AC, thinking: The problem involves a triangle where the incenter and circumcenter have a perpendicular relationship. This suggests the triangle might have special properties. The given circumradius (R = 13) and inradius (r = 6) can be used in known relationships for triangles, such as Euler&#39;s formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, or formulas involving the area and semiperimeter. However, there seems to be a discrepancy with the semi-perimeter value given as 78, which was noted as incorrect. Without the correct semi-perimeter or side lengths, finding AB * AC directly is challenging. The perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI might suggest a right triangle or specific angle conditions, but without more information, it&#39;s difficult to proceed.; answer: 468\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Verify the correct semi-perimeter or provide side lengths or another geometric relationship involving AB, AC, and the given radii.\nCritic agent Nbyg, on the purpose of reviewing AB * AC calculation, thinking: The answer provided by the Chain-of-Thought Agent vib8 is 468, which is incorrect. The agent suggests verifying the semi-perimeter or providing side lengths, but it does not correctly utilize the given information about the triangle&#39;s circumradius and inradius. The perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI is a key hint that the triangle is right-angled at A, which allows the use of specific geometric properties to find AB * AC. The correct approach involves using the formula for the product of the sides in a right triangle in terms of its circumradius and inradius, which is AB * AC = 4Rr. Substituting the given values of R = 13 and r = 6, we find AB * AC = 4 * 13 * 6 = 312.; answer: False\nCoT agent vib8, on the purpose of refining AB * AC calculation, thinking: The previous attempts did not correctly utilize the information that IA ⊥ OI implies a special property of the triangle. This is a key hint that the triangle is right-angled at A. For a right triangle with circumradius R and inradius r, there is a known relationship AB * AC = 4Rr. Given R = 13 and r = 6, we can use this formula to find AB * AC directly.; answer: 312\nCritic agent Nbyg, on the purpose of reviewing AB * AC calculation, thinking: The reasoning and answer seem correct. The key insight is recognizing that IA ⊥ OI implies the triangle is right-angled at A, allowing us to use the relationship AB * AC = 4Rr for right triangles. Given R = 13 and r = 6, the calculation is straightforward: 4 * 13 * 6 = 312.; answer: True&#34;]

final_reponse: [&#39;The previous attempts did not correctly utilize the information that IA ⊥ OI implies a special property of the triangle. This is a key hint that the triangle is right-angled at A. For a right triangle with circumradius R and inradius r, there is a known relationship AB * AC = 4Rr. Given R = 13 and r = 6, we can use this formula to find AB * AC directly.\n\nAnswer:312&#39;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable**: The sub-tasks are not fully solvable as indicated by the presence of `&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;` in the answers for Sub-task 1 and Sub-task 2. The decomposition issue persists, and the tasks need further refinement to be specific and detailed enough for the agents to solve them. The current decomposition does not provide enough guidance or information for the agents to solve them effectively. This is a case of (a) decomposition issue.

(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not include all necessary information from the original query, particularly in leveraging the geometric properties implied by the perpendicularity condition. The sub-tasks fail to connect the given properties in a way that leads to a solvable problem. The connections between sub-tasks are not clearly established, leading to a lack of necessary information flow.

(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains low, indicating the final answer is incorrect. This is due to the lack of effective decomposition and the inability of the current architecture to solve the sub-tasks. The final response is still incorrect, suggesting the need for updated instructions to avoid known wrong answers.

(2) Improvements: The implementation should be revised to include more detailed and specific sub-task instructions. The sub-tasks need to be further decomposed to make them solvable by the agents. Additionally, the final sub-task should include instructions to avoid known incorrect answers, based on the memory of past incorrect responses.

thought: 
(1) **Further Decomposition**: The previous sub-task 1 was to calculate the semi-perimeter using the formula A = r * s, which was too broad. We can decompose it further as follows:

- Last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1: Calculate the semi-perimeter s using the formula A = r * s and the given inradius r = 6. Consider using known properties of right triangles or any necessary assumptions based on the triangle&#39;s properties.

- Last sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2: Calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter found in sub-task 1 and verify its consistency with the given circumradius. Explore the use of known geometric theorems that relate the circumradius, inradius, and area.

- Last sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 3: Use the perpendicularity condition and any known geometric theorems to find AB * AC, ensuring to avoid known incorrect answers.

These new sub-tasks are more specific and provide a clearer path to solving the problem, ensuring that each step builds on the previous one.

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**: The final sub-task should include instructions to avoid known incorrect answers. For example, &#34;It is known that 78, 156, and 312 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the agents to explore alternative solutions and avoid repeating past mistakes.

The perpendicularity condition suggests a special geometric configuration, possibly involving a right triangle or isosceles triangle. The circumradius and inradius provide constraints that can be used with known geometric theorems. To find AB * AC, we need to correctly interpret the perpendicularity condition and apply it to the triangle&#39;s properties.

We know the circumradius R = 13 and the inradius r = 6. The area A can be expressed as A = r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter.

Alternatively, exploring the perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI might reveal a special configuration or relationship that can be used to find the area or semi-perimeter.\nCoT-SC agent m0uU, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: To calculate the area of the triangle, we need to know the semi-perimeter and the side lengths. The area can be expressed as A = r * s, where r is the inradius. However, we need to verify its consistency with the circumradius by using A = abc / (4R). Without the side lengths or angles, we cannot directly use these formulas. Given the perpendicular condition IA ⊥ OI and the radii, the triangle might have special properties, but additional information about the sides or angles is necessary to find a consistent solution.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: To make progress, we need more information about the side lengths or angles of the triangle. One approach could be to explore properties of triangles with IA ⊥ OI and relate them to the given radii.\nCoT-SC agent D1QZ, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: To find the area of the triangle, we need to relate the given circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6 to the area A. The formula for the area A in terms of the circumradius R and the side lengths is A = abc / (4R). We also have the formula A = r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Without knowing the side lengths or having a direct way to find the semi-perimeter, it&#39;s challenging to calculate the area directly. We might need to explore additional geometric relationships or properties of the triangle, such as the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI, which might imply a special configuration or identity.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider using the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI, which might imply a special configuration or identity, such as a right triangle or specific angle relationships, to find more information about the side lengths or semi-perimeter.\nCoT-SC agent M7Rr, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: We are given the circumradius R = 13 and the inradius r = 6, but we do not have the semi-perimeter s directly. We know that the area A of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semi-perimeter as A = r * s, and also in terms of the circumradius and side lengths as A = abc / (4R). However, without additional information about the side lengths or angles, it is difficult to calculate the area or semi-perimeter directly. We might need to use additional geometric properties or relations, such as those involving the orthogonality condition IA ⊥ OI, to find a way to relate these quantities.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: To calculate the area of the triangle, we need more information about the side lengths or angles. Consider exploring geometric properties involving the orthogonality condition IA ⊥ OI or other relations that involve the circumradius and inradius.\nCoT-SC agent 4rS4, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: The problem involves a triangle with given circumradius and inradius, and we need to find the product of two sides. The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) suggests a right triangle property, possibly involving Euler&#39;s relation or other known theorems. However, without direct access to the side lengths or angles, calculating the semi-perimeter or area directly is challenging. We might need to use trigonometric identities or geometric theorems that relate these elements.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider exploring known geometric theorems or identities that relate the circumradius, inradius, and side lengths, such as Euler&#39;s relation or the extended law of sines. Additional information about the triangle&#39;s angles or specific side length ratios would be helpful.\nCoT agent EkMQ, on the purpose of calculating AB * AC, thinking: The problem involves a triangle with given circumradius and inradius, and a specific perpendicularity condition between the incenter and circumcenter. The perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI suggests that the triangle might have a right angle or a special configuration. Given the circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6, we can use known formulas relating these quantities to the sides of the triangle. Specifically, the formula R = abc/(4A) and the area A = rs can be used. However, the specific perpendicularity condition is key to solving the problem. The perpendicularity condition implies that AI is tangent to the nine-point circle of the triangle, which is a specific geometric property. By considering the properties of the nine-point circle and the triangle&#39;s incircle, we can find relationships between the sides. Using these relationships and known geometric theorems, we can solve for AB * AC.; answer: 312\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider using the relationship between the perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI and the properties of the nine-point circle or Euler&#39;s circle. This might involve special configurations or symmetries in the triangle, such as being isosceles or having certain angle measures. Understanding these properties could lead to the correct computation of AB * AC.\nCritic agent 8tNW, on the purpose of reviewing AB * AC calculation, thinking: The answer provided by Chain-of-Thought Agent EkMQ is incorrect, as it states 312, which is known to be incorrect. The explanation suggests using the perpendicularity IA ⊥ OI and properties of the nine-point circle, but it does not provide a clear path to the solution. The suggestion to consider special configurations or symmetries is reasonable, but the specific calculation or reasoning leading to the correct value of AB * AC is missing.; answer: False\nCoT agent EkMQ, on the purpose of refining AB * AC calculation, thinking: The previous attempts struggled with the perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI and how it affects the triangle&#39;s configuration. The condition suggests a special geometric property, possibly involving the nine-point circle or Euler&#39;s circle. The known incorrect answers (78, 156, 312) indicate a misunderstanding or miscalculation. The circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6 provide constraints that can be related through known geometric theorems. To find AB * AC, we need to correctly interpret the perpendicularity condition and apply it to the triangle&#39;s properties. Given the complexity and the lack of a direct path from the known conditions to the product AB * AC, it seems more information or a different approach is needed.; answer: 312\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Further exploration of the perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI and its implications on the triangle&#39;s configuration, possibly involving the nine-point circle or Euler&#39;s circle, might be necessary. Additionally, consider whether the triangle has any special properties, such as being isosceles or having specific angle measures, that could simplify the problem.\nCritic agent 8tNW, on the purpose of reviewing AB * AC calculation, thinking: The answer 312 provided by the agent is incorrect, as it was previously given as an incorrect answer. The reasoning mentions the perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI, but does not adequately explain how to use this condition to find the product AB * AC. The suggestion to explore the nine-point circle or Euler&#39;s circle might not directly help in solving for AB * AC without a clear path. The agent also suggests considering special properties of the triangle, but does not fully explore this possibility. The problem remains unsolved with the current approach.; answer: False\nCoT agent EkMQ, on the purpose of refining AB * AC calculation, thinking: The previous attempts failed to correctly interpret the perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI and relate it to the triangle&#39;s properties. The condition suggests a special geometric relationship, potentially involving the triangle being isosceles or having certain angle measures. The circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6 provide constraints, but without a clear understanding of the configuration, it is difficult to directly compute AB * AC. The known incorrect answers indicate a misunderstanding. A different approach or additional information about the triangle&#39;s configuration might be necessary.; answer: 312\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider exploring the implications of the perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI more deeply, possibly involving specific geometric properties or configurations of the triangle. Additional information about the triangle&#39;s side lengths or angles could also be helpful.\nCritic agent 8tNW, on the purpose of reviewing AB * AC calculation, thinking: The approach in thinking #3 recognizes the importance of the perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI but does not provide a concrete method to solve for AB * AC. The answer 312 is given without justification or derivation, which suggests it might not be based on a correct understanding of the problem. The suggestion to explore the geometric implications of the perpendicularity condition is valid, but the answer lacks evidence of such exploration.; answer: False\nCoT agent EkMQ, on the purpose of refining AB * AC calculation, thinking: The previous attempts have consistently failed to correctly use the given conditions, particularly the perpendicularity IA ⊥ OI, to solve for AB * AC. The condition suggests a special geometric property, possibly involving a right triangle or an isosceles triangle, but this was not fully explored. The circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6 provide constraints that could be used in conjunction with the perpendicularity condition to find the product AB * AC. The repeated incorrect answer of 312 indicates a misunderstanding or misapplication of geometric principles. A deeper exploration of the implications of IA ⊥ OI, possibly involving properties of the nine-point circle or Euler&#39;s circle, might reveal the correct configuration or relationships needed to solve the problem. Without a clear path from the given conditions to the product AB * AC, it seems that more information or a novel approach is needed.; answer: 312\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Further exploration of the specific geometric implications of IA ⊥ OI is needed. Consider whether the triangle is isosceles or has a right angle, and how these properties interact with the given circumradius and inradius.\nCritic agent 8tNW, on the purpose of reviewing AB * AC calculation, thinking: The answer 312 is incorrect. The reasoning does not fully utilize the given condition IA ⊥ OI. This condition suggests a specific geometric property that was not fully explored. The circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6 provide constraints that need to be used correctly in conjunction with the perpendicularity condition. The repeated incorrect answer of 312 indicates a misunderstanding or misapplication of geometric principles. The problem may involve special properties of the triangle, such as it being isosceles or having a right angle, which were not considered in the solution.

This suggests a special geometric configuration. The circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6 provide constraints that could be used with known geometric theorems.

Known incorrect answers indicate previous misunderstandings.

However, without further verification or detailed steps showing how the product AB * AC was calculated, it&#39;s difficult to confirm the accuracy of the answer 468. It would be beneficial to see the derivation or reasoning that leads to this result to ensure all geometric properties and constraints are correctly applied.; answer: False\nCoT agent EkMQ, on the purpose of refining AB * AC calculation, thinking: The problem involves a triangle with specific conditions: circumradius R = 13, inradius r = 6, and the perpendicularity IA ⊥ OI.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable**: The sub-tasks remain unsolvable due to their broad nature, as indicated by the `&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;` label. The decomposition is insufficient, and the tasks need to be further broken down into more specific and manageable steps. Sub-tasks 1 and 2, in particular, lack the necessary detail and context to be effectively tackled by the agents. This is primarily a decomposition issue (a).

(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not fully encapsulate the necessary information from the original query to ensure a comprehensive solution. Critical geometric properties and relationships implied by the problem are not adequately explored or connected in the sub-tasks. This results in a lack of necessary information flow between the tasks.

(3) **Fitness**: The fitness remains low, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The repeated incorrect answers suggest that the current architecture and task decomposition are not effectively guiding the agents towards the correct solution. The final response needs to be updated to avoid known incorrect answers.

(2) Improvements: The sub-tasks should be revised to include more specific instructions and a clearer connection to the original problem. The final sub-task should explicitly avoid known incorrect answers, as indicated by the memory of past incorrect responses.

(1) **Further Decomposition**: The previous sub-task 1 was too broad. We can decompose it further as follows:

- Last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1: Identify any special properties of the triangle based on the given perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI. Consider if the triangle has specific characteristics like being right-angled or isosceles.

- Last sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2: Based on the special properties identified in sub-task 1, calculate the semi-perimeter s using the formula A = r * s and the given inradius r = 6. Provide any necessary assumptions or relationships based on the triangle&#39;s properties.

- Last sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 3: Calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter found in sub-task 2 and verify its consistency with the given circumradius. Explore the use of known geometric theorems that relate the circumradius, inradius, and area.

- Last sub-task 4 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4: Use the perpendicularity condition and any known geometric theorems to find AB * AC, ensuring to avoid known incorrect answers.

These new sub-tasks are more specific and provide a clearer path to solving the problem, ensuring that each step builds on the previous one.

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**: The final sub-task should include instructions to avoid known incorrect answers. For example, &#34;It is known that 78, 156, 312, and 468 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the agents to explore alternative solutions and avoid repeating past mistakes.

Next, we verify this area with the circumradius R = 13 using the formula A = abc / (4R). However, without knowing the side lengths directly, we can&#39;t verify using this formula. We need additional relationships between the circumradius, inradius, and side lengths to fully verify the consistency. The given information suggests a special configuration, possibly an isosceles triangle, but more details are needed to explore this further.; answer: 216\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide specific side lengths or angles, or clarify if any specific formulas or relationships should be used to verify the area with the circumradius.\nCoT-SC agent o5ma, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: We know that the area of the triangle A can be calculated using the formula A = r * s, where r is the inradius and s is the semi-perimeter. From Sub-task 2, we have s = 36. Therefore, the area A = 6 * 36 = 216. We can verify this area by considering the relationship between the circumradius R, inradius r, and area A. For a triangle, A = abc / (4R), where R is the circumradius. However, without the specific side lengths a, b, and c, we cannot verify this directly.

The semi-perimeter s was calculated as 36 in Sub-task 2. Using the formula A = r * s, where r is the inradius (6), we can find the area A = 6 * 36. However, we should verify this with the circumradius R = 13. The area A can also be calculated using the formula A = abc / (4R), but we lack the side lengths. We need to check if the area from the inradius and semi-perimeter matches with what is expected from the circumradius and side lengths.; answer: 216\nCoT-SC agent bMzd, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: To calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter and verify its consistency with the given circumradius, we start with the area formula A = r * s, where r is the inradius and s is the semi-perimeter. From Sub-task 2, we have s = 36, hence the area A is 6 * 36 = 216. We also know the circumradius R = 13. To verify consistency, we use the formula A = abc / (4R).

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable**: The sub-tasks remain unsolvable as indicated by the `&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;` label in the responses. The decomposition still lacks specificity and fails to break down the problem into manageable, solvable components. This is a decomposition issue (a) since the tasks are too broad and lack detailed instructions to guide the agents effectively.

(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not fully capture all necessary information from the original query. While they attempt to address the geometric properties of the triangle, they do not provide a clear or comprehensive path to the final solution. Critical relationships and properties are either omitted or insufficiently explored, leading to incomplete information flow between sub-tasks.

(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The repeated incorrect answers suggest that the current architecture and task decomposition are not effectively guiding the agents towards the correct solution. The final response needs to be updated to avoid known incorrect answers.

(2) Improvements: The implementation should be revised to include more specific instructions and a clearer connection to the original problem. The final sub-task should explicitly avoid known incorrect answers, as indicated by the memory of past incorrect responses.

thought: (1) **Further Decomposition**: The previous sub-task 1 was too broad. We can decompose it further as follows:

- Last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1: Identify any special properties of the triangle based on the given perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI. Consider if the triangle has specific characteristics like being right-angled or isosceles.

- Last sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2: Based on the special properties identified in sub-task 1, calculate the semi-perimeter s using the formula A = r * s and the given inradius r = 6. Provide any necessary assumptions or relationships based on the triangle&#39;s properties.

- Last sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 3: Calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter found in sub-task 2 and verify its consistency with the given circumradius. Explore the use of known geometric theorems that relate the circumradius, inradius, and area.

- Last sub-task 4 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4: Use the perpendicularity condition and any known geometric theorems to find AB * AC, ensuring to avoid known incorrect answers.

These new sub-tasks are more specific and provide a clearer path to solving the problem, ensuring that each step builds on the previous one.

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**: The final sub-task should include instructions to avoid known incorrect answers. For example, &#34;It is known that 78, 156, 312, and 468 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the agents to explore alternative solutions and avoid repeating past mistakes.

The condition IA ⊥ OI suggests a special geometric configuration, possibly involving a known theorem or property of the triangle. The area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semi-perimeter, as well as in terms of the side lengths and circumradius. However, without additional side length information or a specific theorem that directly relates IA ⊥ OI to AB * AC, it is challenging to find the exact value.

We know the inradius is 6 and the semi-perimeter is 72, but we need to verify consistency with the circumradius. Using the formula A = r * s, the area is 6 * 72 = 432. To check consistency with the circumradius, we can use the formula A = abc / (4R) where R is the circumradius. However, without the side lengths, it&#39;s hard to verify directly. We need additional relationships or side lengths to proceed further.; answer: 432\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: We need the side lengths or another geometric relationship to verify the area with the circumradius. Consider using properties of isosceles triangles or additional theorems relating circumradius and inradius.\nCoT-SC agent 8A2b, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: To find the area of triangle ABC, we need to use the given inradius r = 6 and the semi-perimeter s = 72 from Sub-task 2. The area A can be calculated as A = r * s = 6 * 72 = 432. We can verify this area using known geometric theorems. For example, we can use the relationship A = abc/(4R), where R is the circumradius and a, b, c are the side lengths. However, without knowing a, b, and c, we can&#39;t directly verify using this formula. We also know that for an isosceles triangle, we have relationships between the circumradius, inradius, and the area, but further calculations require more specific side length information.

However, without the side lengths or additional properties, it is difficult to directly compute the area or verify consistency with the circumradius. We might need to use additional geometric theorems or relationships specific to isosceles triangles or the given conditions.; answer: 72\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: To calculate the area of the triangle, consider using relationships involving the circumradius, inradius, and semi-perimeter specific to isosceles triangles. Alternatively, use known geometric theorems or properties that can relate these elements to find the area.\nCoT-SC agent 5kaK, on the purpose of calculating area, thinking: The problem involves finding the product AB * AC in a triangle with specific properties. We know the triangle is isosceles, and we have the circumradius and inradius. However, without explicit side lengths or a way to calculate the area directly, it&#39;s challenging to find the semi-perimeter or the area needed to solve the problem directly. The circumcenter and incenter relationship might imply a special configuration, but additional geometric insights or theorems are needed to proceed.; answer: 72\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: To solve this problem, we need to explore the relationship between the circumradius, inradius, and the semi-perimeter in isosceles triangles.

We know that the area of the triangle can be expressed as A = r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter. The area can also be expressed as A = abc / (4R), where a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle. The perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI suggests a special configuration, possibly involving the exradius or another geometric property. However, without additional side length information or a specific theorem relating IA ⊥ OI to AB * AC, it&#39;s challenging to find the exact value.

This condition suggests a special geometric configuration that might involve specific properties of the triangle, possibly related to the Euler line or other circle-related theorems.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable**: The sub-tasks remain unsolvable, as indicated by the repeated `&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;` responses. The decomposition is insufficient, and the tasks need to be further broken down into more specific and manageable steps. This is primarily a decomposition issue (a), as the tasks remain too broad and lack detailed instructions to guide the agents effectively.

(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not fully capture all necessary information from the original query. While they attempt to address the geometric properties of the triangle, they do not provide a clear or comprehensive path to the final solution. Critical relationships and properties are either omitted or insufficiently explored, leading to incomplete information flow between sub-tasks.

(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The repeated incorrect answers suggest that the current architecture and task decomposition are not effectively guiding the agents towards the correct solution. The final response needs to be updated to avoid known incorrect answers.

(2) Improvements: The implementation should be revised to include more specific instructions and a clearer connection to the original problem. The final sub-task should explicitly avoid known incorrect answers, as indicated by the memory of past incorrect responses.

thought: (1) **Further Decomposition**: The previous sub-task 1 was too broad. We can decompose it further as follows:

- Last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1: Identify any special properties of the triangle based on the given perpendicularity condition IA ⊥ OI. Consider if the triangle has specific characteristics like being right-angled or isosceles.

- Last sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2: Based on the special properties identified in sub-task 1, calculate the semi-perimeter s using the formula A = r * s and the given inradius r = 6. Provide any necessary assumptions or relationships based on the triangle&#39;s properties.

- Last sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 3: Calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter found in sub-task 2 and verify its consistency with the given circumradius. Explore the use of known geometric theorems that relate the circumradius, inradius, and area.

- Last sub-task 4 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4: Use the perpendicularity condition and any known geometric theorems to find AB * AC, ensuring to avoid known incorrect answers.

These new sub-tasks are more specific and provide a clearer path to solving the problem, ensuring that each step builds on the previous one.

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**: The final sub-task should include instructions to avoid known incorrect answers. For example, &#34;It is known that 78, 156, 312, 468, and 300 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the agents to explore alternative solutions and avoid repeating past mistakes.
