    <pre>A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

### thinking by Debate Agent p4MY:
To satisfy the conditions, we need an even number of elements to ensure the median is not in the list. The mode is 9, so 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. Using four 9s, we have 9, 9, 9, 9 and two other numbers, x and y, such that x + y = 6 to make the sum 30. The median should be the average of the two middle numbers, which is not in the list. By choosing x = 3 and y = 3, we have the list [3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9]. The median is (3 + 9) / 2 = 6, which is not in the list. This satisfies all conditions: the sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is not in the list. Now, to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list, calculate 3^2 + 3^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2.
