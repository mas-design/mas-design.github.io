    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all given conditions. Let&#39;s denote the list as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \), sorted in non-decreasing order. The conditions are: 
1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9, meaning 9 appears more frequently than any other number.
3. The median is a positive integer not in the list.

Let&#39;s start by considering the mode condition. Since 9 is the mode, it must appear more than any other number. Let&#39;s assume 9 appears \( k \) times, where \( k \geq 2 \), since it must be the unique mode.

Next, consider the median condition. For the median to not be in the list, the list must have an even number of elements (say \( 2m \)) so that the median is the average of the \( m \)-th and \( (m+1) \)-th elements, which can be a non-integer not in the list. 

Let&#39;s try \( n = 6 \) (smallest even number greater than or equal to 4, as the mode must appear at least twice). The median will be the average of the 3rd and 4th numbers.

Assume the list is \( a_1, a_2, 9, 9, a_5, a_6 \). The sum is \( 30 \), so \( a_1 + a_2 + a_5 + a_6 + 9 + 9 = 30 \), leading to \( a_1 + a_2 + a_5 + a_6 = 12 \).

We want the median \( \frac{9 + a_5}{2} \) to not be an integer, so \( a_5 \neq 9 \) and \( a_5 \neq a_6 \), and \( \frac{9 + a_5}{2} \) must not be a whole number.

Let \( a_5 = 8 \) (since 8 is the largest integer less than 9 that could make the median non-integer). Then \( a_1 + a_2 + a_6 = 4 \). 

Try \( a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_6 = 2 \). This gives the list \( 1, 1, 9, 9, 8, 2 \), which sums to 30 and has a mode of 9. The median is \( \frac{9 + 8}{2} = 8.5 \), not an integer.

Now, calculate the sum of squares: 
\( 1^2 + 1^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 8^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 1 + 81 + 81 + 64 + 4 = 232 \).
