        "Solvable": "The sub-task 3 output contained <TOO_HARD>, indicating that generating possible lists was too complex for the block used. The sub-task 5 output also shows incorrect answers, indicating it was not solvable by the block used. This suggests that the tasks are still too difficult and require further decomposition. The architecture is struggling with the complexity of the problem.",
        "Completeness": "The sub-tasks include necessary information from the original query, but the connection between sub-tasks could be improved to ensure all necessary information is carried forward effectively. Ensuring that each sub-task builds on the previous ones is crucial.",

This makes sub-task 4 simpler as it only focuses on verifying the generated lists, and sub-task 5 focuses on calculating the sum of squares.
