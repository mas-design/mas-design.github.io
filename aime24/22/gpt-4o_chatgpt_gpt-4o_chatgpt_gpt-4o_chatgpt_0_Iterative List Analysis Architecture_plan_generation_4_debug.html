    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

    <pre>thought: 
**Decomposition:**
The given problem is a complex mathematical problem involving properties of a list of integers. To solve this, we can decompose the task into simpler sub-tasks that can be handled by the existing blocks:

1. **Sub-task 1:** Identify the constraints and properties of the list. This involves understanding the conditions given: the sum of the list is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list.

2. **Sub-task 2:** Based on the output of sub-task 1, generate possible lists that satisfy the identified constraints. This involves generating lists that adhere to the sum, mode, and median conditions.

3. **Sub-task 3:** Based on the outputs from sub-task 2, calculate the sum of the squares of the items in each valid list. This involves iterating over the lists generated in sub-task 2 and computing the required sum of squares.

The decomposition ensures each sub-task is simpler and solvable by the given blocks. Sub-task 1 is focused on understanding, sub-task 2 on generation, and sub-task 3 on computation, each of which aligns well with the capabilities of the existing architectures.

**Overall Architecture:**
To solve each sub-task, we will connect the existing blocks as follows:

1. **Sub-task 1:** Use the &#34;Chain-of-Thought&#34; block to identify and understand the constraints of the list. This block is well-suited for step-by-step reasoning required to parse and interpret the problem statement.

2. **Sub-task 2:** Use the &#34;Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought&#34; block to generate possible lists. This block will allow the generation of multiple possible lists by leveraging varied reasoning paths.

3. **Sub-task 3:** Use the &#34;Self-Refine (Reflexion)&#34; block to calculate the sum of the squares of the items in the lists generated in sub-task 2. This block can iteratively refine the calculation process to ensure accuracy.

**Implementation:**
The implementation involves setting up the connections between these blocks to address each sub-task, ensuring the correct flow of information and computation.

The list must also be structured to satisfy these conditions simultaneously.; answer - The constraints and properties of the list are: 1) The sum of the list elements is 30. 2) The mode of the list is 9, meaning 9 appears more frequently than any other number. 3) The median is a positive integer not present in the list.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To generate possible lists that satisfy the constraints, we need to ensure the sum of the list is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list. To have a unique mode of 9, 9 must appear more times than any other number. The median not being in the list implies an even number of elements, so the list must have an even length, and the average of the two middle numbers is not in the list.

The list must have an odd number of elements for the median to be a single integer, and since the mode is 9, 9 must appear more than any other number. Let&#39;s start with a list where 9 appears at least twice, and adjust the other numbers to satisfy the sum and median conditions.; answer: One possible list is [9, 9, 1, 4, 7]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 4, which is not in the list. Another possible list is [9, 9, 1, 5, 6].

The mode being 9 means 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. The median being an integer not in the list suggests the list has an even number of elements, as an odd number of elements would make the median an element of the list. We can start by assuming there are two 9s, and then adjust the remaining elements to satisfy the sum and median condition.; answer: One possible list that satisfies the constraints is [9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 5]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median, which is 3, does not appear in the list.\nCoT-SC agent ADvZ, on the purpose of generating lists, thinking: To generate possible lists, we need to satisfy all the constraints: the sum of the list must be 30, the mode must be 9, and the median must be a positive integer not in the list. Given that 9 is the mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number. The median being a number not in the list suggests the list has an even number of elements, as the median would then be the average of the two middle numbers, which can be a number not in the list.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;The sub-task 2 output contained &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that the task was too complex for the block used.

sub_tasks: [&#39;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The list of positive integers must satisfy several conditions: the sum of the integers is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list. Since the mode is 9, 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. The median being a number not in the list implies that the list must have an even number of elements, as the median of an odd-length list would be an element from the list itself. Therefore, the list likely has an even number of elements, and the two middle elements average to the median value, which is not in the list.; answer - The constraints are: sum = 30, mode = 9, median is not in the list, and the list likely has an even number of elements.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The list has an even number of elements, so the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Since the median is not in the list, it must be a number that can be expressed as the average of two integers in the list. The list must sum to 30, have a mode of 9, and have a median not present in the list. The median could be any integer that is not in the list, and it must be between the smallest and largest numbers in the list. Possible values for the median include numbers not in the list that can be the average of two numbers in the list.; answer - Possible values for the median are integers that are not in the list and can be expressed as the average of two integers in the list. Without specific elements, potential candidates for the median could be numbers like 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, assuming these are not in the list.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The task requires constructing a list of positive integers that sum to 30, have a unique mode of 9, and a median that is a positive integer not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements, so the median is the average of two numbers in the list. In previous attempts, errors were made in ensuring the median was not in the list or in calculating the sum correctly. A valid list must satisfy all conditions: correct sum, unique mode of 9, and a median not in the list. The list [5, 7, 9, 9] satisfies these conditions, with a sum of 30, a mode of 9, and a median of 8, which is not in the list. The sum of the squares of the numbers in the list is calculated as 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.; answer - 236\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The task involves constructing a list of positive integers that sum to 30, have a unique mode of 9, and a median that is not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements for the median to be an average of two numbers. The list [5, 7, 9, 9] has a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and a median of 8, which is not in the list. The sum of squares is calculated as 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 236. Previous answers like 332, 248, and 245 are incorrect, but 236 is consistent with the conditions given.; answer - 236&#39;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent ccdH, on the purpose of identifying constraints, thinking: The list of positive integers must satisfy several conditions: the sum of the integers is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list. Since the mode is 9, 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. The median being a number not in the list implies that the list must have an even number of elements, as the median of an odd-length list would be an element from the list itself. Therefore, the list likely has an even number of elements, and the two middle elements average to the median value, which is not in the list.; answer: The constraints are: sum = 30, mode = 9, median is not in the list, and the list likely has an even number of elements.\nCoT agent esKr, on the purpose of determining median values, thinking: The list has an even number of elements, so the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Since the median is not in the list, it must be a number that can be expressed as the average of two integers in the list. The list must sum to 30, have a mode of 9, and have a median not present in the list. The median could be any integer that is not in the list, and it must be between the smallest and largest numbers in the list. Possible values for the median include numbers not in the list that can be the average of two numbers in the list.; answer: Possible values for the median are integers that are not in the list and can be expressed as the average of two integers in the list. Without specific elements, potential candidates for the median could be numbers like 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, assuming these are not in the list.\nReflexion CoT agent C276, on the purpose of generating lists, thinking: To generate possible lists, we need to ensure the list sums to 30, has a unique mode of 9, and has a median that is not in the list. The median candidates based on sub-task 2 are 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. Let&#39;s consider a list with an even number of elements, as the median must not be in the list. A possible approach is to try different list lengths, ensuring the mode is 9 and the median is one of the candidates. For example, if the median is 6, a possible list could be [1, 2, 9, 9, 9, 10], where the median is (2+10)/2 = 6, which is not in the list, and the mode is 9. We need to check this for other median candidates.; answer: [1, 2, 9, 9, 9, 10] is a possible list with median 6. Another possibility with median 5 could be [1, 3, 9, 9, 9, 8], where the median is (3+8)/2 = 5. For median 4, a list could be [1, 7, 9, 9, 9, 5], with median (7+5)/2 = 6, which is not 4, so let&#39;s adjust: [1, 3, 9, 9, 9, 7] with median 4. For median 7, [2, 4, 9, 9, 9, 6] with median (4+6)/2 = 5, adjust: [2, 5, 9, 9, 9, 6] with median 7. For median 8, [1, 4, 9, 9, 9, 7], median (4+9)/2 = 6. Adjust: [1, 5, 9, 9, 9, 6] with median 8. \n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Verify each list for correct median and mode, and explore other list lengths or combinations, as this problem might have multiple valid solutions.\nCritic agent Sv2d, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The lists provided do not satisfy all the conditions. The median must be a positive integer not in the list, and the mode must be 9. The lists need to be verified for these conditions and adjusted accordingly.; answer: The lists need to be recalculated to ensure they meet all the problem criteria, including having the correct sum, mode, and median.\nReflexion CoT agent C276, on the purpose of refining list generation, thinking: The task is to find a list of positive integers that sum to 30, have a unique mode of 9, and a median that is a positive integer not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements for the median to be the average of two numbers in the list. Previous attempts did not satisfy all conditions, particularly the median requirement. We need to carefully construct the list to meet all criteria, including the correct sum, mode, and median. Let&#39;s try constructing such a list again, ensuring the mode is 9, the sum is 30, and the median is not in the list.; answer: One valid list is [3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 3], where the sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 6 (the average of the two middle 9s), which is not in the list. The sum of the squares of this list is 3^2 + 3^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = 9 + 9 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 9 + 9 = 522.\nCritic agent Sv2d, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The list provided does not satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list. The median of [3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3, 3] is 9, which is in the list. We need to find a list where the median is not in the list itself.; answer: The correct list should have an even number of elements so that the median is the average of two numbers. A possible list is [3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6]. This list sums to 30, the mode is 9, and the median is (3 + 9) / 2 = 6, which is not in the list. The sum of the squares is 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 6^2 = 9 + 9 + 9 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 36 = 468.\nReflexion CoT agent C276, on the purpose of refining list generation, thinking: The task requires finding a list of positive integers that sum to 30, have a unique mode of 9, and a median that is not in the list. Previous attempts failed to ensure the median was not in the list. Since the median must be an integer not in the list, and the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of two middle numbers. We should try constructing a list that meets these criteria, ensuring the mode is 9 and the median is not in the list.; answer: One valid list is [1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is (9+9)/2 = 9, which is in the list. This does not work. Let&#39;s adjust: [2, 2, 9, 9, 9, 9]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is (9+9)/2 = 9, which is in the list. This does not work either. Adjust: [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 5, which is not in the list. This works. The sum of the squares is 1^2 + 1^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 1 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 4 = 330.\nCritic agent Sv2d, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The previous attempt correctly identified a list that meets the criteria: the sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is not in the list. However, the list provided in the answer was incorrect. Let&#39;s try again to construct a valid list.; answer: Consider a list [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 5, which is not in the list. The sum of the squares is 1^2 + 1^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 1 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 4 = 330.\nReflexion CoT agent C276, on the purpose of refining list generation, thinking: The task requires constructing a list of positive integers that sum to 30, have a unique mode of 9, and a median that is not in the list. Previous attempts failed due to incorrect median calculations or lists that did not meet all conditions. The list must have an even number of elements, and the median should be the average of two numbers in the list that results in an integer not present in the list. I will try to construct such a list again, ensuring all conditions are satisfied.; answer: One valid list is [1, 1, 8, 9, 9, 2]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is (8+9)/2 = 8.5, which is not an integer. Adjust: [1, 2, 9, 9, 9, 5]. The sum is 35, which is incorrect. Adjust: [1, 2, 9, 9, 9, 0]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is (9+9)/2 = 9, which is in the list. Adjust: [1, 2, 8, 9, 9, 1]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is (8+9)/2 = 8.5, which is not an integer. Adjust: [1, 2, 7, 9, 9, 2]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is (7+9)/2 = 8, which is not in the list. This works. The sum of the squares is 1^2 + 2^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 + 49 + 81 + 81 + 4 = 220.\nCritic agent Sv2d, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The previous attempts failed due to incorrect median calculations and lists that did not meet all conditions.

The sum of the squares is 220.\nReflexion CoT agent C276, on the purpose of refining list generation, thinking: The task requires constructing a list of positive integers that sum to 30, have a unique mode of 9, and a median that is a positive integer not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements, so the median is the average of two numbers in the list. The list must be carefully constructed to meet all criteria: correct sum, unique mode of 9, and a median not in the list. Previous attempts failed due to incorrect median calculations or lists that did not meet all conditions. Let&#39;s construct such a list again, ensuring all conditions are satisfied.; answer: One valid list is [6, 6, 9, 9]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is (6+9)/2 = 7.5, which is not an integer. Adjust: [5, 7, 9, 9]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is (7+9)/2 = 8, which is not in the list. This works. The sum of the squares of the numbers in the list is 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.\nCritic agent Sv2d, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The previous attempt correctly identified a list that satisfies all the conditions: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is not in the list.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

The mode being unique means 9 appears more often than any other number, so it appears at least twice. The median not being in the list suggests an even number of elements in the list, as the median would be the average of two central numbers. These constraints help us form the list.; answer - The list must have an even number of elements, the sum of the elements is 30, and 9 appears more frequently than any other number. Additionally, the median is not in the list.

The median being an integer not in the list suggests it could be a number like 5, 6, 7, or 8, as these are integers that could reasonably be the average of two middle numbers without being in the list itself.; answer - The possible values for the median that are not in the list are 5, 6, 7, or 8.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We need to construct lists of positive integers that sum to 30, have 9 as the unique mode, and have a median that is an integer not in the list.

The unique mode being 9 suggests that 9 appears more frequently than any other number. The median condition implies that the list must have an odd number of elements, as for an even number of elements, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers, which cannot be a positive integer not in the list. Thus, the list has an odd number of elements, and the middle element (the median) is not in the list.

The mode being 9 implies there are more 9s than any other number in the list.; answer: Possible lists:\n- For median 5: [1, 4, 9, 9, 9, 9] (sum = 30, mode = 9, median = 5)\n- For median 6: [3, 4, 9, 9, 9, 9] (sum = 30, mode = 9, median = 6)\n- For median 7: [2, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9] (sum = 30, mode = 9, median = 7)\n- For median 8: [1, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9] (sum = 30, mode = 9, median = 8)\nEach list has the correct sum, mode, and median.\nCoT-SC agent 2xIb, on the purpose of generating lists, thinking: To generate possible lists, we need to satisfy all conditions: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is one of the values 5, 6, 7, or 8, which does not appear in the list. Given the mode 9, it must appear more frequently than any other number. The median being an integer not in the list suggests the list has an even number of elements, and the median is the average of the two middle numbers. We need to construct lists that meet these criteria and calculate the sum of the squares of each list.; answer: One possible list is [3, 9, 9, 9]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 6 (average of 3 and 9), which is not in the list. The sum of squares is 3^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 3 + 81 + 81 + 81 = 246.\n\nAnother possible list is [4, 9, 9, 8]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 6.5 (average of 4 and 9), which is not in the list. The sum of squares is 4^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 8^2 = 16 + 81 + 81 + 64 = 242.\n\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Further decomposition could involve systematically constructing lists for each possible median value and verifying if they satisfy all conditions.\nCoT-SC agent RceN, on the purpose of generating lists, thinking: To generate possible lists, we need to ensure the list has an even number of elements with a sum of 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list. The median could be 5, 6, 7, or 8. For each median, we can try to construct a list that satisfies all conditions. For example, if the median is 5, the list could be [1, 2, 9, 9, 9] with a duplicate of 9 to ensure it is the mode. The sum must be 30, so we adjust other numbers accordingly. This process can be repeated for other median values.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Generate lists for each possible median by ensuring the sum is 30, mode is 9, and median is not in the list. Consider lists of different lengths and configurations to satisfy all conditions.\nCoT-SC agent eNXh, on the purpose of generating lists, thinking: We need to construct lists of positive integers where the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is one of the values 5, 6, 7, or 8, which is not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements for the median to be the average of two middle numbers. The mode being 9 means 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. Let&#39;s consider each possible median and construct lists accordingly.; answer: (1) If the median is 5, a possible list is [3, 4, 9, 9, 10, 14].\n(2) If the median is 6, a possible list is [3, 4, 9, 9, 11, 13].\n(3) If the median is 7, a possible list is [3, 5, 9, 9, 12, 13].\n(4) If the median is 8, a possible list is [4, 6, 9, 9, 11, 13].\nDebate agent WiIy, round 0, on the purpose of verifying lists, thinking: We need to verify the lists for the correct sum, mode, and median.

However, the problem states that the answers 332, 248, 245, and 236 are incorrect. We must calculate the sum of squares for each list and avoid these results.

The sum of squares is 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 4 + 4 + 81 + 81 + 49 = 220. 220 is not one of the incorrect answers, so it is valid.\nDebate agent WiIy, round 1, on the purpose of verifying lists, thinking: We need to verify the lists for correct sum, mode, and median.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

From these conditions, we can deduce that the list must contain multiple 9s, and the median implies an even number of elements to ensure it is not an element of the list.

Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, the average of the n-th and (n+1)-th elements must be an integer not present in the list. The list sums to 30, and the mode is 9, so there must be multiple 9s in the list. We need to find positive integer values for the median such that the list can be constructed with these conditions.; answer - Possible median values are integers greater than 0 that are not in the list and can be averages of two consecutive elements in a sorted list summing to 30 with 9 as the mode.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To generate possible lists, we need to consider the properties: the sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements, say 2n, and the median is the average of the n-th and (n+1)-th elements. Since the median is not in the list, we need to find pairs of numbers whose average is an integer not in the list. We also need to ensure that 9 appears more frequently than any other number to be the unique mode. This is a complex problem because it involves balancing these constraints to find all possible lists.; answer - There are multiple possible lists for each median, depending on the constraints and combinations. \n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Specify a particular median value to generate a list for that specific case.\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The task requires generating a list of positive integers with a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and a median that is a positive integer not in the list. The constraints make this problem complex: 9 must appear more frequently than any other number, and the median, which is not in the list, implies an even number of elements. Previous attempts struggled due to the complexity of these constraints. A systematic approach is needed: fix the number of elements, choose a median, and generate lists satisfying the mode and sum conditions.

The median not being in the list suggests an even number of elements. Let&#39;s attempt to construct such a list. A possible list could be [9, 9, 9, 1, 2] with a median of 5 (not in the list). However, this doesn&#39;t satisfy the sum condition. We need to adjust the list to satisfy all conditions. Consider [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1] with a median of 5, but the sum is too low. A corrected example is [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1] with a median of 5, but this doesn&#39;t work. Finally, try [9, 9, 9, 1, 2] with a median of 5. Adjustments might be needed to satisfy all constraints, such as [9, 9, 9, 1, 2, 0].; answer - 300\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider breaking down the problem by fixing the number of elements and systematically adjusting the list to satisfy all conditions.

agents: [&#34;CoT agent Q8Pi, on the purpose of identifying constraints, thinking: The problem provides several constraints: 1) The sum of the integers in the list is 30. 2) The mode, which is the number that appears most frequently, is 9 and it is unique. 3) The median, which is the middle number in an ordered list, is an integer not in the list itself. From these conditions, we can deduce that the list must contain multiple 9s, and the median implies an even number of elements to ensure it is not an element of the list. The list must be constructed to satisfy these constraints while summing to 30.; answer: Constraints: 1) Sum of list = 30. 2) Unique mode = 9. 3) Median is an integer not in the list.\nCoT agent RVQB, on the purpose of determining median values, thinking: The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, and since the median is not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements. Let&#39;s denote the number of elements in the list as 2n. The median will be the average of the n-th and (n+1)-th elements in the sorted list. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, the average of the n-th and (n+1)-th elements must be an integer not present in the list. The list sums to 30, and the mode is 9, so there must be multiple 9s in the list. We need to find positive integer values for the median such that the list can be constructed with these conditions.; answer: Possible median values are integers greater than 0 that are not in the list and can be averages of two consecutive elements in a sorted list summing to 30 with 9 as the mode.\nCoT-SC agent KJ20, on the purpose of generating lists, thinking: To generate possible lists, we need to consider the properties: the sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements, say 2n, and the median is the average of the n-th and (n+1)-th elements.

Since the median is not in the list, it suggests the list has an even number of elements, say 2n. The median will be the average of the n-th and (n+1)-th elements. We need to ensure that 9 appears more frequently than any other number, and the list must sum to 30. We can try different configurations to see what works.; answer: Possible lists for different medians:\n\n1. If the median is 5, the list could be [3, 4, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9].\n2. If the median is 6, the list could be [3, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9].\n3. If the median is 7, the list could be [4, 5, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9].\n4.

The list must have an even number of elements, say 2n, and the median is the average of the n-th and (n+1)-th elements. The mode being 9 means there are at least two 9s in the list. We need to find combinations of numbers that satisfy these conditions for each possible median value identified in sub-task 2.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide specific possible median values from sub-task 2 to generate corresponding lists, as the median values and their constraints are essential for constructing the lists.\nCoT-SC agent qrZf, on the purpose of generating lists, thinking: We need to construct lists of positive integers that sum to 30, have 9 as the unique mode, and have a median that is a positive integer not in the list. The median will be the average of the n-th and (n+1)-th elements of a sorted list with an even number of elements. The possible values for the median need to be determined first, but without specific values for the median from sub-task 2, it&#39;s challenging to generate exact lists. However, we can explore lists with different numbers of 9s and arrange the other numbers to achieve different potential medians. Let&#39;s assume the list has 6 elements, which would make the median the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. If 9 is the mode, there should be at least 3 nines. Let&#39;s explore lists with this setup.; answer: Possible lists for different medians:\n\n1. If the median is 5 (not in the list), a possible list could be [4, 6, 9, 9, 9, 3].\n2. If the median is 7 (not in the list), a possible list could be [6, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1].\n3.

The list must have an even number of elements, so the median is the average of two middle numbers. We need to determine lists for each possible median value, ensuring 9 is the most frequent number and the sum is 30.; answer: Possible lists for each median are constructed by ensuring the list has an even number of elements, the sum is 30, 9 is the mode, and the median is an integer not in the list. This requires careful balance of numbers and trial to ensure all conditions are met.\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: We need to know specific possible median values to generate accurate lists. Further decomposition into finding specific median values can help.\nReflexion CoT agent uopi, on the purpose of verifying lists, thinking: To verify the generated lists, we need to check if they satisfy the conditions: the sum must be 30, the mode must be 9, and the median must be a positive integer not present in the list. This involves checking each list against these criteria. However, without specific lists provided, this task cannot be completed directly. The problem requires generating lists that satisfy all conditions, which involves complex combinatorial reasoning.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide specific lists or constraints to verify, or decompose the task into smaller steps such as generating lists with a fixed number of elements first.\nCritic agent o0CO, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The task involves verifying lists against multiple conditions, which can be complex without specific examples.; answer: The task requires checking lists for sum, mode, and median properties, but without specific lists, it&#39;s difficult to verify.\nReflexion CoT agent uopi, on the purpose of refining verification, thinking: The task involves finding a list of positive integers that satisfy specific conditions: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list. Previous attempts indicate that generating such lists is complex due to the constraints on the mode and median. The unique mode requirement implies 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. Additionally, the median being an integer not in the list complicates the list generation, as it implies the list has an even number of elements. Without specific lists or constraints, the problem remains too complex to solve directly.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider fixing the number of elements in the list first and then systematically generating lists that satisfy the mode and median conditions. This can help break down the task into smaller, more manageable steps.\nCritic agent o0CO, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The task involves generating a list of positive integers that meet specific criteria: a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and a median that is not in the list. The unique mode condition means 9 must appear more frequently than any other number, and the median condition implies an even number of elements.

The mode condition implies 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. The median condition suggests the list has an even number of items, as the median is not in the list.

Consider specific examples or constraints to simplify the problem.\nCritic agent o0CO, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The problem involves creating a list of positive integers with specific properties, which can be tricky. The key is to ensure the mode is unique and appears more frequently than any other number, while also ensuring the median is not in the list. Previous attempts may have struggled with balancing these constraints.; answer: To solve this, we can start by assuming the list has an even number of elements, which means the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Since the median is not in the list, it must be a number that is not equal to any of the list elements. We need to ensure that 9 is the unique mode, meaning it appears more frequently than any other number. After setting these constraints, we can try constructing a list that sums to 30. One possible list is [9, 9, 9, 1, 2]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median (which is the average of the two middle numbers 9 and 1) is 5, which is not in the list. The sum of squares is 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 243 + 1 + 4 = 248.\nReflexion CoT agent uopi, on the purpose of refining verification, thinking: The problem involves creating a list of positive integers that sum to 30, have 9 as the unique mode, and a median that is not in the list.

Previous attempts have struggled because it&#39;s difficult to satisfy all conditions simultaneously. A systematic approach is necessary.; answer: To solve the problem, we need a list of integers that sum to 30, with 9 as the unique mode, and a median that is not in the list. Let&#39;s try constructing such a list systematically.\n\n1. The mode is 9, so we need 9 to appear more frequently than any other number. Let&#39;s assume 9 appears three times.\n\n2. The sum of the list is 30. If we have three 9s, their sum is 27. We need the remaining numbers to sum to 3.\n\n3. The median is not in the list. If we have an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Let&#39;s try a list of 6 elements: [9, 9, 9, a, b, c].\n\n4. The sum of a, b, and c is 3. Possible values could be 1, 1, and 1.\n\n5. The list [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1] has a median of (9 + 1)/2 = 5, which is not in the list.\n\n6. The sum of squares is 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 243 + 3 = 246.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is 246.\nReflexion CoT agent uopi, on the purpose of refining verification, thinking: The task requires generating a list of positive integers with a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and a median that is a positive integer not in the list.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem provides several constraints for the list of positive integers. First, the sum of the items in the list must be 30. Second, the unique mode of the list is 9, meaning 9 appears more frequently than any other number. Third, the median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, which means the list must have an even number of elements so that the median can be the average of the two middle numbers. These constraints help define the structure of the list and guide the calculation of the sum of squares.; answer - The list must satisfy: 1) Sum of elements = 30, 2) Mode = 9, 3) Median is an integer not in the list. These guide the list&#39;s construction.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, and the list must have an even number of elements for the median to be the average of two numbers, we need to consider what integers could be the median that are not part of the list. The sum of the list is 30, so the median should be less than 30. The mode is 9, which appears more frequently than any other number. If the list has n elements, the median is the average of the n/2-th and (n/2 + 1)-th elements. These two numbers must average to an integer not in the list. Possible values for the median could be integers like 8, 10, 11, etc., which are not in the list of numbers summing to 30 with mode 9.; answer - Possible median values are integers like 8, 10, 11, etc., that are not in the list.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We need to generate possible lists that satisfy the given conditions: the sum of the list is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. We also know the list must have an even number of elements. We will try different possible median values that are not in the list and construct lists accordingly.; answer - Possible lists:\n\nFor median 8:\nList: [9, 9, 9, 1, 2]\n\nFor median 10:\nList: [9, 9, 9, 1, 2]\n\nFor median 11:\nList: [9, 9, 9, 1, 2]\n\nThese lists are examples that satisfy the conditions, but further exploration is needed to ensure all conditions are met. &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Explore other combinations or provide more constraints to narrow down the possibilities.\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The problem requires constructing a list of positive integers with a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and an integer median not present in the list. The list must have an even number of elements to have a median that is not in the list. Previous attempts failed due to incorrect median calculations or incorrect mode. A correct list should balance these conditions: the mode is 9, the sum is 30, and the median is an integer not in the list. By considering these constraints, a possible list is [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 6]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 5, which is not in the list. However, the sum of this list was incorrectly calculated in previous attempts. Re-evaluating the sum and ensuring all conditions are met, we need to find a correct list that satisfies all conditions.; answer - 333\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - To solve the problem, we need a list of positive integers that sums to 30, has a unique mode of 9, and a median that is an integer not present in the list. The list must have an even number of elements for the median to be a non-present integer. A valid list is [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 6], which sums to 30, has a mode of 9, and a median of 5. The sum of squares for this list is 9^2 * 4 + 1^2 * 3 + 6^2 = 324 + 3 + 36 = 363.; answer - 363&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent aZFk, on the purpose of identifying constraints, thinking: The problem provides several constraints for the list of positive integers. First, the sum of the items in the list must be 30. Second, the unique mode of the list is 9, meaning 9 appears more frequently than any other number. Third, the median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, which means the list must have an even number of elements so that the median can be the average of the two middle numbers. These constraints help define the structure of the list and guide the calculation of the sum of squares.; answer: The list must satisfy: 1) Sum of elements = 30, 2) Mode = 9, 3) Median is an integer not in the list. These guide the list&#39;s construction.\nCoT agent euQD, on the purpose of determining median values, thinking: Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, and the list must have an even number of elements for the median to be the average of two numbers, we need to consider what integers could be the median that are not part of the list. The sum of the list is 30, so the median should be less than 30. The mode is 9, which appears more frequently than any other number.

Possible values for the median could be integers like 8, 10, 11, etc., which are not in the list of numbers summing to 30 with mode 9.; answer: Possible median values are integers like 8, 10, 11, etc., that are not in the list.\nCoT-SC agent 4sHH, on the purpose of generating lists, thinking: We need to generate possible lists that satisfy the given conditions: the sum of the list is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. We also know the list must have an even number of elements. We will try different possible median values that are not in the list and construct lists accordingly.; answer: Possible lists:\n\nFor median 8:\nList: [9, 9, 9, 1, 2]\n\nFor median 10:\nList: [9, 9, 9, 1, 2]\n\nFor median 11:\nList: [9, 9, 9, 1, 2]\n\nThese lists are examples that satisfy the conditions, but further exploration is needed to ensure all conditions are met. &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Explore other combinations or provide more constraints to narrow down the possibilities.\nCoT-SC agent GF9r, on the purpose of generating lists, thinking: To generate possible lists for each median, we need to ensure that the sum of the list is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements for the median to be the average of the two middle numbers. Let&#39;s consider possible medians like 8, 10, and 11, and try to construct lists that satisfy these conditions. For each potential median, we need to ensure that 9 appears more frequently than any other number, and the two middle numbers average to the median value.; answer: For median 10: A possible list is [9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 13]. The sum is 30, mode is 9, and median is 10.\nFor median 11: A possible list is [9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 14]. The sum is 30, mode is 9, and median is 11.\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider more median values and construct lists for each to ensure all possibilities are covered.\nCoT-SC agent xCQo, on the purpose of generating lists, thinking: To generate possible lists for each median, we need to ensure that the list of integers sums to 30, has 9 as the unique mode, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. The list should have an even number of elements to have a median that is the average of two numbers. We can start by considering small lists and adjusting them to meet the conditions. For example, if the median is 8, the list could be [9, 9, 9, 1, 2], which sums to 30, has 9 as the mode, and the median (average of 2nd and 3rd elements) could be adjusted to not include 8 in the list. Similarly, for other medians like 10 or 11, we can create lists by trial and error while ensuring all conditions are met.; answer: Possible lists for each median include:\n- Median 8: [9, 9, 9, 1, 2], adjust to meet conditions.\n- Median 10: [9, 9, 9, 3], adjust to meet conditions.\n- Median 11: [9, 9, 9, 1, 2], adjust to meet conditions.\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider generating lists by trial and error, ensuring the sum is 30, mode is 9, and median is not in the list. More specific examples or constraints may help.\nCoT-SC agent NLR8, on the purpose of generating lists, thinking: To generate possible lists, we need to satisfy the conditions: the sum of the list is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. We try different median values such as 8, 10, or 11 and construct lists that satisfy these conditions. The list must have an even number of elements for the median to be the average of two numbers. We also need to ensure that 9 appears more frequently than any other number. This problem requires trial and error to find valid lists for each possible median.; answer: One possible list with median 10 is: [9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 5, 3]. This list sums to 30, has a mode of 9, and the median (average of 4th and 5th elements) is 10, which is not in the list.\nAnother possible list with median 8 is: [9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4]. This list sums to 30, has a mode of 9, and the median (average of 4th and 5th elements) is 8, which is not in the list.\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Further exploration of different combinations and verifying the constraints for each possible median value would help in finding all possible lists.\nCoT-SC agent eKOi, on the purpose of generating lists, thinking: The list must sum to 30, have a unique mode of 9, and an integer median that is not in the list. The median implies an even number of elements, and the mode suggests 9 appears more than any other number. For each possible median from sub-task 2, we need to construct a list that satisfies all conditions. We will try to construct lists for medians like 8, 10, 11, etc., ensuring the sum is 30, mode is 9, and median is not in the list.; answer: For median 8:\nList: [9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 2]\nFor median 10:\nList: [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 3]\nFor median 11:\nList: [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 2]\n\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: More details on constructing lists for each median, ensuring mode and sum conditions.\nReflexion CoT agent nDYn, on the purpose of verifying lists, thinking: To verify the generated lists, we need to check if they satisfy the conditions of having a sum of 30, the unique mode being 9, and the median being a positive integer not in the list. The lists provided by the Chain-of-Thought Agent 4sHH are all the same: [9, 9, 9, 1, 2]. First, we check the sum: 9 + 9 + 9 + 1 + 2 = 30, which is correct. Next, we check the mode: the number 9 appears three times, which is more than any other number, so 9 is the unique mode. Finally, we check the median: since the list [1, 2, 9, 9, 9] has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which is 9. However, the given task specifies that the median should not appear in the list, so these lists do not satisfy all the conditions. The lists need to be re-evaluated to find a valid median that is not in the list.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the lists to find a valid median that is not in the list, as the current lists do not satisfy the condition for the median.\nCritic agent BeF0, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The previous attempts failed to find a list that satisfies all the conditions: sum of 30, unique mode of 9, and a median that is not in the list.; answer: To solve the task, we need to find a list of positive integers where the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is not in the list. One possible list is [9, 9, 9, 1, 2, 0]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median (when sorted [0, 1, 2, 9, 9, 9]) is (2+9)/2 = 5.5, which is not in the list.\nReflexion CoT agent nDYn, on the purpose of refining verification, thinking: The previous attempts provided lists that did not satisfy all the conditions. The mode must be 9, the sum must be 30, and the median should not be in the list. The list must have an even number of elements to have a median that is not in the list. We need to find such a list by considering different lengths and distributions of numbers.; answer: The correct list that satisfies all conditions is: [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 4, 5]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 6, which is not in the list. The sum of squares is 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 + 16 + 25 = 366. 366\nCritic agent BeF0, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The previous attempt incorrectly identified a list that did not satisfy all conditions. The list must have an even number of elements to have a median that is not in the list, and the mode must be 9 with the sum of 30.; answer: The correct list that satisfies all conditions is: [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 2, 2, 3]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 6, which is not in the list. The sum of squares is 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 9 = 342. 342.\nReflexion CoT agent nDYn, on the purpose of refining verification, thinking: The task requires finding a list of positive integers with a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and a median that is not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements for the median condition to be satisfied. Previous attempts failed to satisfy all conditions simultaneously. The key is to ensure the mode is 9, the sum is 30, and the median is not in the list. The list should be sorted to easily determine the median.; answer: The correct list that satisfies all conditions is: [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 2, 2]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 6, which is not in the list. The sum of squares is 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 333.\nCritic agent BeF0, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The previous attempt did not satisfy the condition that the median should not be in the list. The list [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 2, 2] has a median of 9, which is in the list. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.; answer: To find the correct list, we need to ensure the median is not in the list. The list should have an even number of elements so that the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Let&#39;s try a list with 6 elements: [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is (9 + 1)/2 = 5, which is not in the list. The sum of squares is 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 243 + 3 = 246.\nReflexion CoT agent nDYn, on the purpose of refining verification, thinking: The task requires finding a list of positive integers with a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and a median that is not in the list. The list must have an even number of elements for the median condition to be satisfied. Previous attempts failed because they did not satisfy the condition of the median not being in the list or did not have the correct mode. To solve this, we need to construct a list with an even number of elements, ensure the mode is 9, and select a median that does not appear in the list. A possible list is [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 2, 5]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is (2+5)/2 = 3.5, which is not in the list.; answer: 366\nCritic agent BeF0, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The previous attempt incorrectly assumed the median could be non-integer while the problem specifies it must be a positive integer not in the list. The list [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 2, 5] has an incorrect median of 3.5. A correct attempt should ensure the median is an integer not in the list. Consider a list with an even number of elements where the sum is 30, mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list.; answer: To satisfy the conditions, let&#39;s try: [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 8, 2]. The sum is 48. The list should be: [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 2, 8]. The sum is 48. The mode is 9. The median is (2+8)/2 = 5, which is not in the list. The sum of squares: 9^2 * 4 + 1^2 * 2 + 2^2 + 8^2 = 81*4 + 1*2 + 4 + 64 = 324 + 2 + 4 + 64 = 394.\nReflexion CoT agent nDYn, on the purpose of refining verification, thinking: The problem requires constructing a list of positive integers with a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and an integer median not present in the list. The list must have an even number of elements to have a median that is not in the list. Previous attempts failed due to incorrect median calculations or incorrect mode. A correct list should balance these conditions: the mode is 9, the sum is 30, and the median is an integer not in the list. By considering these constraints, a possible list is [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 6]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 5, which is not in the list.; answer: 366\nCritic agent BeF0, on the purpose of feedback, thinking: The proposed list [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 6] has a sum of 45, not 30, which violates the first condition. Additionally, the median of this list is 5, which is not in the list, but the sum is incorrect. A correct list should satisfy all conditions: sum of 30, mode of 9, and a median not in the list.; answer: A correct list with these properties is [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1]. The sum is 30, the mode is 9, and the median is 5, which is not in the list. The sum of the squares is 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 243 + 3 = 246.\nReflexion CoT agent nDYn, on the purpose of refining verification, thinking: The problem requires constructing a list of positive integers with a sum of 30, a unique mode of 9, and an integer median not present in the list.

However, the sum of this list was incorrectly calculated in previous attempts. Re-evaluating the sum and ensuring all conditions are met, we need to find a correct list that satisfies all conditions.; answer: 333\nCoT agent 38Cs, on the purpose of calculating sum of squares, thinking: To solve the problem, we need a list of positive integers that sums to 30, has a unique mode of 9, and a median that is an integer not present in the list. The list must have an even number of elements for the median to be a non-present integer. A valid list is [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 6], which sums to 30, has a mode of 9, and a median of 5. The sum of squares for this list is 9^2 * 4 + 1^2 * 3 + 6^2 = 324 + 3 + 36 = 363.; answer: 363&#34;]

final_reponse: [&#39;To solve the problem, we need a list of positive integers that sums to 30, has a unique mode of 9, and a median that is an integer not present in the list. The list must have an even number of elements for the median to be a non-present integer. A valid list is [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 6], which sums to 30, has a mode of 9, and a median of 5.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`
