    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all the given conditions: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. Let&#39;s denote the list as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) with \(a_1 \le a_2 \le \ldots \le a_n\). The unique mode being 9 means that 9 appears more times than any other number. The median not being in the list implies that the list has an odd number of elements and the middle element is not in the list. Let&#39;s try constructing such a list. Assume the list has 7 elements (an odd number), and since the sum is 30, we need to allocate numbers such that the mode is 9 and the median is not in the list. A possible construction is: \(1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 9, 9\). Here, the sum is \(1 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 42\), which is incorrect. Let&#39;s retry with 6 elements. For 6 elements, the median would be the average of the 3rd and 4th element, which doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition. Let&#39;s try 5 elements: \(1, 5, 7, 9, 9\). Here, the sum is \(1 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 31\), still incorrect. Adjusting, let&#39;s try 7 elements again: \(1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9\). The sum is \(1 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 47\), incorrect. Finally, let&#39;s try 8 elements: \(1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9\). The sum is \(1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 48\), incorrect. Let&#39;s try \(1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9\), the sum is \(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 56\), incorrect. We need to adjust the list to satisfy all conditions. A correct combination is \(1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 9, 9, 9\), the sum is \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 46\), incorrect. Finally, \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 9, 9\) gives \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 42\), incorrect. Let&#39;s try \(1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 9, 9\), the sum is \(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 38\), incorrect. Finally, \(1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 9, 9\) gives \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 37\), incorrect. Let&#39;s try \(1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 9\), the sum is \(1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 9 = 30\), correct. The median is \(6\), which is not in the list. Now, calculate the sum of squares: \(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 6^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 36 + 81 + 81 = 212\).
