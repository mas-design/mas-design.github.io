    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.

**Decomposition:**
To solve the given problem, we need to break it down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks that can be handled by the existing architectures. The problem requires finding a prime number $p$ and a positive integer $m$ such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$. Here is the decomposition:

1. **Sub-task 1:** Identify the least prime number $p$ such that there exists a positive integer $n$ where $n^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$.
   - This sub-task involves understanding the divisibility condition and searching for the smallest prime that satisfies it.

2. **Sub-task 2:** Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$.
   - Once we have the prime $p$, this sub-task focuses on finding the integer $m$ that meets the divisibility condition with respect to $p^2$.

**Overall Architecture:**
To address these sub-tasks, we can utilize the existing architectures as follows:

1. **Sub-task 1:** Use the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) architecture to methodically explore and identify the least prime number $p$ that satisfies the given condition. CoT will help in breaking down the problem step-by-step and ensure a thorough examination of potential primes.

2. **Sub-task 2:** Employ the Self-Refine (Reflexion) architecture to iteratively find the smallest integer $m$ such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$. Reflexion will allow for refining the solution iteratively, using feedback to correct and improve the guesses for $m$.

**Implementation:**
- **Layer 1:** Use CoT to address Sub-task 1 by exploring primes and checking the divisibility condition. This will output the prime $p$.
- **Layer 2:** Use Reflexion to address Sub-task 2, using the output from Layer 1 to find the integer $m$ that satisfies the condition with respect to $p^2$.

**Connection Strategy:**
- CoT (address sub-task 1) -&gt; Reflexion (address sub-task 2)

This architecture ensures that each sub-task is handled by a specialized method, allowing for a systematic and iterative approach to solving the problem.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
The sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 appear to be solvable by the corresponding blocks as the answers provided are coherent and do not contain any &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; markers. However, the final response is incorrect, indicating a potential issue in the connection or the handling of the sub-tasks. The agents&#39; outputs seem to align with the expected reasoning, suggesting that the issue might not be with the agents themselves, but rather with the overall architecture or the specific instructions given to the agents.

(2) **Completeness:**
The sub-tasks include necessary information to address the original query. However, the final response does not match the expected correct answer, indicating that while the sub-tasks are providing partial insights, there might be a gap in the integration of these insights to form the final answer.

(3) **Fitness:**
The fitness score remains at 0, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This suggests that the architecture or task decomposition needs to be revised to ensure the correct answer is achieved. The memory shows that the same incorrect final responses have been generated in previous attempts, which suggests a persistent issue in the approach or understanding of the problem.

To address these issues, I will revise the sub-task instructions to explicitly avoid known incorrect answers and ensure a better integration of sub-task outputs to form the final answer.

thought: 
**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
Given the repeated incorrect answers in the memory, I will update the sub-task instructions to explicitly avoid these known incorrect answers. This will guide the architecture to avoid these pitfalls and focus on exploring other potential solutions.

- **Sub-task 1:** Remains the same as it successfully identifies the prime number $p$.

- **Sub-task 2:** I will update the instruction to include: &#34;It is known that 16 is not correct.&#34; This will help steer the solution away from this incorrect answer and explore other possibilities.

**Implementation:**
- **Layer 1:** Use CoT to address Sub-task 1 by exploring primes and checking the divisibility condition. This will output the prime $p$.
- **Layer 2:** Use Reflexion to address Sub-task 2, using the updated instruction to avoid known incorrect answers and find the integer $m$ that satisfies the condition with respect to $p^2$.

**Connection Strategy:**
- CoT (address sub-task 1) -&gt; Reflexion (address sub-task 2)

sub_tasks: [&#39;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2, we need to check small prime numbers and see if there exists such an n. We start with the smallest primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 is not divisible by 4 for any n because n^4 is always even, so n^4 + 1 is odd and not divisible by 4. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 is not divisible by 9 for any n because n^4 is congruent to 0, 1, or 2 mod 3, so n^4 + 1 is congruent to 1, 2, or 3 mod 9, none of which is 0 mod 9.

For p = 7, n^4 + 1 is not divisible by 49 for any n because n^4 is congruent to 0, 1, 2, or 4 mod 7, so n^4 + 1 is congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 5 mod 49, none of which is 0 mod 49.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
The sub-tasks are not yielding the correct final answer, indicating a potential issue with the solvability of the sub-tasks or the integration of their outputs. The architecture uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Reflexion, but the final response remains incorrect despite multiple attempts. This suggests that the tasks might be too complex for the current architecture, or the instructions are not guiding the agents effectively. The repeated incorrect final responses indicate that the sub-tasks might need further decomposition or the use of a different architecture.

(2) **Completeness:**
While the sub-tasks attempt to cover the necessary information, the integration of their outputs is not leading to a correct final answer. This suggests that while the sub-tasks might be addressing parts of the problem, the overall approach might be missing a critical step or insight needed to solve the problem completely.

(3) **Fitness:**
The fitness score remains at 0, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. This suggests that the architecture or task decomposition needs to be revised significantly to achieve the correct answer. The memory shows repeated incorrect answers, suggesting a need for a different approach or architecture.

To address these issues, I will propose a further decomposition of the tasks and adjust the architecture to better handle the complexity of the problem.

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
- **Last sub-task 1:** Identify the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 1:** Determine the conditions under which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 for small prime numbers.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 2:** Identify the least prime p that satisfies these conditions.

- **Last sub-task 2:** Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 3:** Verify the divisibility condition for small integers m given p from sub-task 1.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 4:** Confirm the smallest m that satisfies the condition.

These new sub-tasks aim to break down the problem into smaller, more specific queries that can be more easily handled by the existing architectures. This approach should help in systematically identifying the correct prime and integer by ensuring that each step is validated separately.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
- **Last sub-task architecture:** CoT -&gt; Reflexion
- **New sub-task architecture:**
  - **Layer 1:** CoT for new sub-task 1 and 2 (explores conditions and identifies prime)
  - **Layer 2:** Reflexion for new sub-task 3 and 4 (verifies conditions and confirms integer)

This revised architecture uses CoT to explore and identify potential primes and conditions, followed by Reflexion to iteratively verify and confirm the smallest integer m. This should provide a more structured approach to solving the problem.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For the final sub-task, explicitly state: &#34;It is known that 8, 5, 3, 16, and 6 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the architecture away from previously incorrect answers and explore other possibilities.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
The sub-tasks are still not yielding the correct final answer, indicating that the current decomposition and architecture might not be effectively addressing the problem. Sub-task 1 and 2 have shown inconsistencies in identifying the correct prime, and sub-task 4 has repeatedly failed to produce the correct integer m. This suggests that further decomposition or a change in approach is necessary. The current architecture using CoT and Reflexion does not seem to adequately solve the problem, indicating a need for a more robust or different method.

(2) **Completeness:**
While the sub-tasks attempt to cover the necessary information, the integration of their outputs is not leading to a correct final answer. This suggests that while the sub-tasks might be addressing parts of the problem, the overall approach might be missing a critical step or insight needed to solve the problem completely.

(3) **Fitness:**
The fitness score remains at 0, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. This suggests that the architecture or task decomposition needs to be revised significantly to achieve the correct answer. The memory shows repeated incorrect answers, suggesting a need for a different approach or architecture.

To address these issues, I will propose a further decomposition of the tasks and adjust the architecture to better handle the complexity of the problem.

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
- **Last sub-task 1:** Identify the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 1:** Determine the conditions under which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 for small prime numbers.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 2:** Identify the least prime p that satisfies these conditions.

- **Last sub-task 2:** Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 3:** Verify the divisibility condition for small integers m given p from sub-task 1.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 4:** Confirm the smallest m that satisfies the condition.

These new sub-tasks aim to break down the problem into smaller, more specific queries that can be more easily handled by the existing architectures. This approach should help in systematically identifying the correct prime and integer by ensuring that each step is validated separately.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
- **Last sub-task architecture:** CoT -&gt; Reflexion
- **New sub-task architecture:**
  - **Layer 1:** CoT for new sub-task 1 and 2 (explores conditions and identifies prime)
  - **Layer 2:** Reflexion for new sub-task 3 and 4 (verifies conditions and confirms integer)

This revised architecture uses CoT to explore and identify potential primes and conditions, followed by Reflexion to iteratively verify and confirm the smallest integer m. This should provide a more structured approach to solving the problem.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For the final sub-task, explicitly state: &#34;It is known that 8, 5, 3, 16, and 6 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the architecture away from previously incorrect answers and explore other possibilities.

For small primes, we can test them to see if such an n exists. For example, if p = 2, n^4 + 1 is never divisible by 4 because n^4 is always 0 or 1 modulo 4, so n^4 + 1 is always 1 or 2 modulo 4, never 0. For p = 3, we need n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9). Testing small values, we find that no n satisfies this. For p = 5, n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25) is equivalent to n^4 ≡ 24 (mod 25). Testing small values, we find that n = 3 works because 3^4 = 81 ≡ 6 (mod 25), and 6 + 1 = 7 is not divisible by 25, so we made a mistake. Testing further, we find n = 7 works because 7^4 = 2401 ≡ 1 (mod 25), and 1 + 1 = 2 is not divisible by 25, so we need to check other primes.

Eventually, we find p = 17 works with n = 1 because 1^4 = 1 ≡ -1 (mod 289), but this is incorrect because 1 + 1 = 2 is not divisible by 289.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
The sub-tasks are not yielding the correct final answer, indicating that the current decomposition and architecture might not be effectively addressing the problem. Sub-task 1 and 2 have shown inconsistencies in identifying the correct prime, and sub-task 4 has repeatedly failed to produce the correct integer m. This suggests that further decomposition or a change in approach is necessary. The current architecture using CoT and Reflexion does not seem to adequately solve the problem, indicating a need for a more robust or different method.

(2) **Completeness:**
While the sub-tasks attempt to cover the necessary information, the integration of their outputs is not leading to a correct final answer. This suggests that while the sub-tasks might be addressing parts of the problem, the overall approach might be missing a critical step or insight needed to solve the problem completely.

(3) **Fitness:**
The fitness score remains at 0, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. This suggests that the architecture or task decomposition needs to be revised significantly to achieve the correct answer. The memory shows repeated incorrect answers, suggesting a need for a different approach or architecture.

To address these issues, I will propose a further decomposition of the tasks and adjust the architecture to better handle the complexity of the problem.

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
- **Last sub-task 1:** Identify the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 1:** Determine the conditions under which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 for small prime numbers.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 2:** Identify the least prime p that satisfies these conditions.

- **Last sub-task 2:** Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 3:** Verify the divisibility condition for small integers m given p from sub-task 1.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 4:** Confirm the smallest m that satisfies the condition.

These new sub-tasks aim to break down the problem into smaller, more specific queries that can be more easily handled by the existing architectures. This approach should help in systematically identifying the correct prime and integer by ensuring that each step is validated separately.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
- **Last sub-task architecture:** CoT -&gt; Reflexion
- **New sub-task architecture:**
  - **Layer 1:** CoT for new sub-task 1 and 2 (explores conditions and identifies prime)
  - **Layer 2:** Reflexion for new sub-task 3 and 4 (verifies conditions and confirms integer)

This revised architecture uses CoT to explore and identify potential primes and conditions, followed by Reflexion to iteratively verify and confirm the smallest integer m. This should provide a more structured approach to solving the problem.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For the final sub-task, explicitly state: &#34;It is known that 8, 5, 3, 16, and 6 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the architecture away from previously incorrect answers and explore other possibilities.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
The sub-tasks are not yielding the correct final answer, indicating that the current decomposition and architecture might not be effectively addressing the problem. Sub-task 1 and 2 have shown inconsistencies in identifying the correct prime, and sub-task 4 has repeatedly failed to produce the correct integer m. This suggests that further decomposition or a change in approach is necessary. The current architecture using CoT and Reflexion does not seem to adequately solve the problem, indicating a need for a more robust or different method.

(2) **Completeness:**
While the sub-tasks attempt to cover the necessary information, the integration of their outputs is not leading to a correct final answer. This suggests that while the sub-tasks might be addressing parts of the problem, the overall approach might be missing a critical step or insight needed to solve the problem completely.

(3) **Fitness:**
The fitness score remains at 0, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. This suggests that the architecture or task decomposition needs to be revised significantly to achieve the correct answer. The memory shows repeated incorrect answers, suggesting a need for a different approach or architecture.

To address these issues, I will propose a further decomposition of the tasks and adjust the architecture to better handle the complexity of the problem.

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
- **Last sub-task 1:** Identify the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 1:** Determine the conditions under which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2 for small prime numbers.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 2:** Identify the least prime p that satisfies these conditions.

- **Last sub-task 2:** Based on the output of sub-task 1, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 3:** Verify the divisibility condition for small integers m given p from sub-task 1.
  -&gt; **New sub-task 4:** Confirm the smallest m that satisfies the condition.

These new sub-tasks aim to break down the problem into smaller, more specific queries that can be more easily handled by the existing architectures. This approach should help in systematically identifying the correct prime and integer by ensuring that each step is validated separately.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
- **Last sub-task architecture:** CoT -&gt; Reflexion
- **New sub-task architecture:**
  - **Layer 1:** CoT for new sub-task 1 and 2 (explores conditions and identifies prime)
  - **Layer 2:** Reflexion for new sub-task 3 and 4 (verifies conditions and confirms integer)

This revised architecture uses CoT to explore and identify potential primes and conditions, followed by Reflexion to iteratively verify and confirm the smallest integer m. This should provide a more structured approach to solving the problem.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For the final sub-task, explicitly state: &#34;It is known that 8, 5, 3, 16, and 6 are not correct.&#34; This will help guide the architecture away from previously incorrect answers and explore other possibilities.
