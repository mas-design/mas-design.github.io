    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n for which n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by this p^2.

First, let&#39;s find such a prime p.

We are given that n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2), which means n^4 ≡ -1 (mod p^2).

This implies that -1 is a fourth power residue modulo p^2.

Consider small primes:

1. For p = 2, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 4). However, n^4 is either 0 or 1 mod 4, so this is not possible.

2. For p = 3, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 9). Checking small n:
   - n = 1, n^4 + 1 = 2
   - n = 2, n^4 + 1 = 17
   - n = 3, n^4 + 1 = 82
   - n = 4, n^4 + 1 = 257

   None of these are divisible by 9.

3. For p = 5, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 25) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 25). Check small n:
   - n = 1, n^4 + 1 = 2
   - n = 2, n^4 + 1 = 17
   - n = 3, n^4 + 1 = 82
   - n = 4, n^4 + 1 = 257
   - n = 5, n^4 + 1 = 626
   - n = 6, n^4 + 1 = 1297

   None of these are divisible by 25.

4. For p = 7, n^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 49) implies n^4 ≡ -1 (mod 49). Check small n:
   - n = 1, n^4 + 1 = 2
   - n = 2, n^4 + 1 = 17
   - n = 3, n^4 + 1 = 82
   - n = 4, n^4 + 1 = 257
   - n = 5, n^4 + 1 = 626
   - n = 6, n^4 + 1 = 1297
   - n = 7, n^4 + 1 = 2402
   - n = 8, n^4 + 1 = 4097

   Check n = 8, n^4 + 1 = 4097, which is divisible by 49.

Thus, the smallest prime p is 7.

Now, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by 49.

We already found that for n = 8, n^4 + 1 = 4097 is divisible by 49.

Thus, the least positive integer m is 8.
