    <pre>There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We need to place chips in a 5x5 grid with each row and column containing chips of the same color. Additionally, the arrangement should be such that adding any more chips would violate the conditions, meaning each row and column must be filled with chips of one color or left empty. 

Consider the possible configurations for the rows:
1. All rows have the same color.
2. Some rows have one color and others have the opposite color.

Since we have 25 chips of each color and need to fill rows or columns completely, the only configurations are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 rows filled with one color and the rest with the other color. The same applies to columns.

For each configuration of rows, we need to check if it is possible to match with a configuration of columns.

Let&#39;s consider the case where k rows are filled with one color and 5-k rows with the other color. Similarly, l columns are filled with one color and 5-l with the other color. We need to ensure that the number of chips of each color used does not exceed 25.

The number of chips of the first color used is k*l, and the number of chips of the second color used is (5-k)*(5-l).

For k rows filled with one color and 5-k rows with the other color, the number of ways to choose which rows are filled with the first color is \( \binom{5}{k} \).

Similarly, the number of ways to choose which columns are filled with the first color is \( \binom{5}{l} \).

We have the constraints:
- k*l &lt;= 25 (since we have 25 chips of each color)
- (5-k)*(5-l) &lt;= 25

For each pair (k, l) that satisfies these constraints, the number of ways is \( \binom{5}{k} \times \binom{5}{l} \).

We need to sum over all valid (k, l) pairs.
