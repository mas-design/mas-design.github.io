        "Solvable": "The current sub-tasks are yielding incorrect final answers. The final response states that 50 chips can be placed optimally, which is not consistent with the problem's constraints. This suggests that the decomposition or the agents within the blocks are not effectively capturing the problem's requirements. The sub-tasks are not effectively guiding the agents to the correct solution, indicating a need for further decomposition or improved architecture.",
        "Completeness": "The sub-tasks do not fully capture all necessary details to ensure a comprehensive final answer. The handling of overlapping cells in the grid is not adequately addressed, leading to incorrect conclusions about the optimal chip placement.",
        "Fitness": "The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The architecture and task decomposition need to be revised to ensure that the final response accurately reflects the problem's constraints.",
        "Inappropriate Implementation": "The current implementation does not effectively guide the agents to the correct solution. The sub-task instructions need to be revised to include known incorrect answers and to better guide the agents through the problem space. This can help avoid repeating past mistakes and improve the final answer."
