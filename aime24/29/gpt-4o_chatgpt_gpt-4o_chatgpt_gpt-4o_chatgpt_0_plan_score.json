    "thinking": "Answer ID 0 suggests filling a 5x5 subgrid with one color and leaving the rest empty, concluding there is only one such arrangement. This reasoning is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of using both colors in different configurations. Answer ID 1 correctly identifies the need to consider various configurations of rows and columns being monochromatic and calculates the number of ways using binomial coefficients. It also checks constraints on the number of chips. Answer ID 2 focuses on partitioning rows into groups of different colors and calculates configurations using binomial coefficients, but incorrectly concludes the total number as 32. Answer ID 3 calculates the number of ways using the sum of squares of binomial coefficients, resulting in 252, which is incorrect as it does not reflect the constraints given. The best answer is Answer ID 1 as it correctly considers the constraints and configurations, resulting in the correct total number of ways as 26.",
