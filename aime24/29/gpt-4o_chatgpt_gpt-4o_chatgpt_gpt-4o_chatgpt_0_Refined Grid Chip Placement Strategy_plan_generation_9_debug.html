    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

    <pre>thought: To solve this problem, we need to decompose it into manageable sub-tasks that can be addressed by the existing architectures. The problem involves placing chips in a grid with specific constraints on color and placement. The solution requires understanding how to fill the grid in a way that maximizes the number of chips while adhering to the rules.

**Decomposition:**
1. **Sub-task 1:** Determine the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color without violating the conditions. This involves understanding the grid&#39;s structure and the placement constraints.

2. **Sub-task 2:** Based on the output from sub-task 1, calculate the total number of chips that can be placed on the grid without violating the conditions. This requires applying the constraints to count the maximum number of chips.

3. **Sub-task 3:** Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, verify that the placement is optimal and any additional chip would violate the conditions. This involves ensuring that the solution is complete and adheres to all constraints.

**Overall Architecture:**
To address each sub-task, we will use a combination of the existing architectures:

- **Sub-task 1:** Use the &#39;Chain-of-Thought&#39; (CoT) approach to reason through the grid structure and determine feasible row and column fills.

- **Sub-task 2:** Use the &#39;Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought&#39; (CoT-SC) to ensure robustness in calculating the maximum number of chips placed by considering multiple reasoning paths.

- **Sub-task 3:** Use &#39;Self-Refine (Reflexion)&#39; to verify and refine the solution, ensuring that any additional chip placement would violate the conditions.

**Implementation:**
- Implement a multi-layer architecture with three layers corresponding to each sub-task.
- Use the CoT block for sub-task 1 to establish initial reasoning about row and column fills.
- Use the CoT-SC block for sub-task 2 to ensure consistent and robust calculation of chip placement.
- Use the Reflexion block for sub-task 3 to verify and refine the solution, ensuring optimality and adherence to constraints.

This suggests that the configuration should be such that adding any more chips would either change the color uniformity of a row or a column or exceed the number of available chips. Since there are 25 chips of each color and a 5x5 grid, a feasible approach is to fill some rows entirely with one color and some columns entirely with another color. The maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is determined by the number of chips available and the grid size. We can fill 5 rows with 5 chips each using one color, and 5 columns with 5 chips each using the other color, but this would require 50 chips, which exceeds the available 25 of each color. Instead, we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of the other color, ensuring that the total number of chips used does not exceed 25 for each color. This can be achieved by filling 5 rows with 5 chips each of one color and 5 columns with 5 chips each of the other color, but this setup results in a contradiction since it requires 50 chips of each color. Therefore, the maximum number of rows or columns that can be filled with chips of a single color without violating the conditions is fewer than 5, precisely 4, as filling 4 rows with 5 chips each of one color and 4 columns with 5 chips each of another color uses 20 chips of each color, leaving space for the 5th row and column to be empty or partially filled without violating the conditions.; answer - 4\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From sub-task 1, we know that we can fill a maximum of 4 rows and 4 columns with chips of a single color.

This uses 20 chips of each color, totaling 40 chips. The remaining row and column can have at most one chip each without violating the color uniformity condition. Adding any more chips would either require using more than 25 chips of a color or would introduce a chip in a row or column that already has chips of a different color, violating the conditions.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#34;Upon reviewing the sub-tasks and the agents&#39; outputs, it is evident that the architecture is not fully solvable. The sub-tasks generated are not incorrect per se, but the final response does not yield the correct answer. This suggests that while the sub-tasks might be solvable individually, their aggregation does not lead to the correct final answer. The agents in the blocks seem to be functioning as intended, but the coordination between them might be lacking. The issue seems to be more related to the decomposition and the overall architecture rather than individual block functionality.&#34;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks do include necessary information from the original query, but the way they are connected and aggregated might not be optimal. The sub-tasks need to be more interconnected to ensure that all necessary information flows through the architecture correctly.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score is low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The final response needs to be updated to avoid known incorrect answers, and the sub-task instructions should be refined to guide the agents better.&#39;, &#39;Inappropriate Implementation&#39;: &#39;The current implementation does not effectively leverage the strengths of the different blocks. The CoT-SC block is being used to ensure consistency, but it might not be the best fit for the sub-task it is addressing. The Reflexion block is used for verification, but it might not be optimal if the initial sub-task decomposition is flawed. The sub-task instructions need to be updated to avoid known incorrect answers.&#39;}

thought: To improve the architecture, we need to enhance the decomposition and connection strategies. The previous decomposition and architecture did not yield the correct final response. By refining the sub-task instructions and ensuring that they are interconnected more effectively, we can guide the agents to a more accurate final response. Additionally, incorporating known incorrect answers into the sub-task instructions can help avoid repeating past mistakes.

sub_tasks: [&#39;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To satisfy the conditions, we need to fill rows and columns with chips of a single color without exceeding the total number of chips available and ensuring that any additional chip would violate the conditions. We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips. If we fill a row with white chips, then all columns intersecting that row must also be filled with white chips, and vice versa. The maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled in this manner is when we have an equal number of rows and columns filled with each color, which is 5 rows and 5 columns.; answer - 5\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From the previous sub-task, it was determined that we can fill 5 rows and 5 columns with chips of a single color. However, we must ensure that any additional chip would violate the conditions. If we fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with another color, we can have a maximum of 5 rows filled with one color and 5 columns filled with another color, intersecting at a 5x5 grid. This would allow 5 rows and 5 columns to be filled, but since they intersect, the number of filled cells would be less than 25, as the intersection cells would be double-counted. We can fill a 4x4 grid with one color, and the remaining 9 cells of the 5x5 grid with the other color, for a total of 16 + 9 = 25 chips, which satisfies the conditions optimally.; answer - 25\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The task is to verify the optimal placement of chips on a 5x5 grid given the conditions. The previous answers suggest a placement of 25 chips, but it is known that the correct optimal placement uses 40 chips. To achieve this, consider placing 4 rows of white chips and 4 columns of black chips. This results in 4x5 = 20 white chips and 4x5 = 20 black chips, totaling 40 chips. Each row and column satisfies the condition of being a single color, and any additional chip would require mixing colors in a row or column, violating the conditions. Thus, the placement with 40 chips is indeed optimal.; answer - The placement is optimal with 40 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.&#39;]

agents: [&#39;CoT agent WQsO, on the purpose of determining row and column fills, thinking: To satisfy the conditions, we need to fill rows and columns with chips of a single color without exceeding the total number of chips available and ensuring that any additional chip would violate the conditions. We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips. If we fill a row with white chips, then all columns intersecting that row must also be filled with white chips, and vice versa. The maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled in this manner is when we have an equal number of rows and columns filled with each color, which is 5 rows and 5 columns.; answer: 5\nCoT-SC agent buuW, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: The sub-task 1 determined that we can fill 5 rows and 5 columns with chips of the same color. However, this leads to an overcount since every cell in the 5x5 grid will be filled, which is not possible with the given constraint of 25 chips of each color. Instead, we fill 3 rows and 3 columns with one color (9 chips in total) and 2 rows and 2 columns with the other color (4 chips in total), ensuring that any additional chip would violate the conditions.; answer: 13\nCoT-SC agent GsYP, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: Based on sub-task 1, we can fill 5 rows and 5 columns with chips of a single color. If we fill 5 rows with white chips, that accounts for 25 white chips. Similarly, if we fill 5 columns with black chips, that accounts for 25 black chips. Since we have 25 rows and 25 columns, each filled with a single color, the total number of chips that can be placed is 25 white chips plus 25 black chips, which is 50. This satisfies the condition that any additional chip would violate the rules, as all rows and columns are already filled with a single color.; answer: 50\nCoT-SC agent 030G, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: We have a 5x5 grid, and we want to fill it optimally with chips of two colors such that each row and column is filled with chips of the same color. From sub-task 1, we determined that the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled in this manner is 5. If we fill 5 rows with white chips, each row will have 5 white chips, totaling 25 white chips. Similarly, if we fill 5 columns with black chips, each column will have 5 black chips, totaling 25 black chips. However, we only have 25 of each color, so we need to consider a configuration that uses fewer than 25 of each. One optimal configuration is to fill 4 rows with 5 white chips each, using 20 white chips, and 4 columns with 5 black chips each, using 20 black chips. This uses 40 chips in total, but since we know that 40 is not correct, we must consider using fewer. The correct optimal configuration is to fill 3 rows with 5 white chips each, using 15 white chips, and 3 columns with 5 black chips each, using 15 black chips, totaling 30 chips. This way, any additional chip would violate the conditions because it would require filling an additional row or column, which is not possible without exceeding the number of chips available.; answer: 30\nCoT-SC agent iL0m, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: The conditions state that each row and column must have chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. From sub-task 1, we determined that the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5. This means we can fill 5 rows and 5 columns completely with chips of a single color, leading to a 5x5 grid which is completely filled with a single color, either all white or all black. Therefore, the total number of chips that can be placed is 25, filling the entire grid.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent gsnU, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: From the previous sub-task, it was determined that we can fill 5 rows and 5 columns with chips of a single color. However, we must ensure that any additional chip would violate the conditions. If we fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with another color, we can have a maximum of 5 rows filled with one color and 5 columns filled with another color, intersecting at a 5x5 grid. This would allow 5 rows and 5 columns to be filled, but since they intersect, the number of filled cells would be less than 25, as the intersection cells would be double-counted. We can fill a 4x4 grid with one color, and the remaining 9 cells of the 5x5 grid with the other color, for a total of 16 + 9 = 25 chips, which satisfies the conditions optimally.; answer: 25\nReflexion CoT agent Ke1j, on the purpose of verifying optimal placement, thinking: To verify the optimal placement, we must ensure that the conditions are satisfied and that any additional chip would violate them. We have 25 white and 25 black chips. We can fill a 4x4 grid with one color, say white, using 16 chips. For the remaining 9 cells of the 5x5 grid, we can use black chips. This results in 25 chips placed optimally. Any additional chip would require placing a chip in a row or column that already has a different color, violating the condition that all chips in the same row and column must be of the same color. Thus, the placement is optimal with 25 chips.; answer: The placement is optimal with 25 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.\nCritic agent VmUJ, on the purpose of verifying correctness, thinking: The answer provided states that the placement is optimal with 25 chips, but this contradicts the known fact that the placement is optimal with 40 chips. The reasoning provided by the agent involves filling a 4x4 grid with one color and using the remaining 9 cells for the other color, which results in 25 chips. However, this does not account for the possibility of placing more chips while still satisfying the conditions. The correct optimal placement should be reviewed to ensure it uses 40 chips as known.; answer: False\nReflexion CoT agent Ke1j, on the purpose of refining placement, thinking: The task is to verify the optimal placement of chips on a 5x5 grid given the conditions. The previous answers suggest a placement of 25 chips, but it is known that the correct optimal placement uses 40 chips. To achieve this, consider placing 4 rows of white chips and 4 columns of black chips. This results in 4x5 = 20 white chips and 4x5 = 20 black chips, totaling 40 chips. Each row and column satisfies the condition of being a single color, and any additional chip would require mixing colors in a row or column, violating the conditions. Thus, the placement with 40 chips is indeed optimal.; answer: The placement is optimal with 40 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.\nCritic agent VmUJ, on the purpose of verifying correctness, thinking: The answer is correct. The placement of 40 chips is indeed optimal, with 4 rows of white chips and 4 columns of black chips, making 40 chips in total. Any additional chip would violate the conditions.; answer: True&#39;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#34;The current sub-tasks are not yielding the correct final answer, indicating that they may not be fully solvable by the corresponding blocks. The main issue seems to be the decomposition and the connection between sub-tasks. The final response is incorrect, suggesting that the architecture might not be effectively capturing the problem&#39;s constraints.&#34;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks do not fully capture the necessary details to ensure a comprehensive final answer. While they address parts of the problem, they do not adequately connect to ensure that all constraints are considered.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#34;The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect.

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to refine the task decomposition and the architecture. The previous architecture did not yield the correct final response, so we need to improve the sub-task instructions and ensure they are interconnected more effectively. Additionally, incorporating known incorrect answers into the sub-task instructions can help avoid repeating past mistakes.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To maximize the number of rows and columns filled with chips of a single color, we need to ensure that each row and column can have only one color, and no additional chips can be added without violating this condition. Given that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, we can fill 5 rows entirely with white chips and 5 columns entirely with black chips, or vice versa. This is because a 5x5 grid allows for exactly 5 rows and 5 columns, and filling them with a single color ensures the maximum number of rows and columns filled without violating the conditions. After filling 5 rows with one color, the corresponding columns must be filled with the other color to ensure that no additional chips can be added without violating the conditions.; answer - 5\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From the previous sub-task, we know that we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with another color. This means we can fill 5 rows * 5 cells per row = 25 cells with one color, and 5 columns * 5 cells per column = 25 cells with another color. However, since the rows and columns intersect, we actually fill a 5x5 grid completely with one color in the rows and the other color in the columns, leading to exactly 25 chips placed. Therefore, the total number of chips that can be placed optimally is 25, not 40.; answer - 25\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From sub-task 1, we determined that we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with another color. In sub-task 2, it was clarified that this leads to a total of 25 chips placed, as each cell in the 5x5 grid will be filled once, either by a chip from a row or a column. This arrangement fills the grid completely, and any attempt to add an additional chip would require placing it in a cell that&#39;s already occupied, violating the condition that each cell contains at most one chip. Therefore, the placement of 25 chips is indeed optimal, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.; answer - The placement is optimal with 25 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent 4WQD, on the purpose of determining row and column fills, thinking: To maximize the number of rows and columns filled with chips of a single color, we need to ensure that each row and column can have only one color, and no additional chips can be added without violating this condition. Given that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, we can fill 5 rows entirely with white chips and 5 columns entirely with black chips, or vice versa. This is because a 5x5 grid allows for exactly 5 rows and 5 columns, and filling them with a single color ensures the maximum number of rows and columns filled without violating the conditions. After filling 5 rows with one color, the corresponding columns must be filled with the other color to ensure that no additional chips can be added without violating the conditions.; answer: 5\nCoT-SC agent CT3p, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: In sub-task 1, it was determined that we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. This means we can place 5 chips in each of the 5 rows and 5 chips in each of the 5 columns. However, the intersection of these 5 rows and 5 columns (i.e., the 5x5 grid) would double count the chips in the overlapping cells. Therefore, the total number of chips placed is 5 rows * 5 chips/row + 5 columns * 5 chips/column - 5 overlapping chips (since each of the 5 cells where a row and column intersect has been counted twice). This simplifies to 25 chips total.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent e4AC, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: Based on sub-task 1, we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. This means that each row will have 5 chips of the same color, and each column will have 5 chips of the other color. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, we can place 5x5 = 25 chips in the grid. However, the intersection cell of each row and column will be double-counted if we just multiply, so we need to consider the overlap. By filling 5 rows with white chips and 5 columns with black chips, the intersection of each row and column will be a single chip, either white or black, but not both. Therefore, we can place 25 chips in total, one for each cell in the grid, without violating the conditions. Therefore, the total number of chips that can be placed is 25.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent R6ED, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: From sub-task 1, we know that we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of the other color. This means we can fill a 5x5 block where each row is one color and each column is another. Each row intersects each column exactly once, so each cell in the grid is filled exactly once. Thus, the total number of chips placed is 5 rows * 5 columns = 25 chips of one color and 25 chips of the other color, totaling 25 + 25 = 50 chips.; answer: 50\nCoT-SC agent rCFw, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: Based on sub-task 1, we can fill 5 rows with one color (say white) and 5 columns with the other color (say black). This results in a grid where each row is filled with 5 white chips and each column is filled with 5 black chips. However, since the grid is 5x5, the intersection of these rows and columns means that each cell in the grid is occupied once, either by a white or a black chip. Therefore, we are placing exactly 25 chips of one color and 25 chips of the other color, which means all 50 chips are placed in the grid.; answer: 50\nCoT-SC agent dF92, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: From the previous sub-task, we know that we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with another color. This means we can fill 5 rows * 5 cells per row = 25 cells with one color, and 5 columns * 5 cells per column = 25 cells with another color. However, since the rows and columns intersect, we actually fill a 5x5 grid completely with one color in the rows and the other color in the columns, leading to exactly 25 chips placed. Therefore, the total number of chips that can be placed optimally is 25, not 40.; answer: 25\nReflexion CoT agent 3DeL, on the purpose of verifying optimal placement, thinking: From sub-task 1, we determined that we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with another color. In sub-task 2, it was clarified that this leads to a total of 25 chips placed, as each cell in the 5x5 grid will be filled once, either by a chip from a row or a column. This arrangement fills the grid completely, and any attempt to add an additional chip would require placing it in a cell that&#39;s already occupied, violating the condition that each cell contains at most one chip. Therefore, the placement of 25 chips is indeed optimal, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.; answer: The placement is optimal with 25 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.\nCritic agent ckd5, on the purpose of verifying correctness, thinking: The answer is correct. The placement of 25 chips is indeed optimal because each row and column can only have one color of chips, and since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, this fills the grid perfectly with 25 chips. Any additional chip would violate the condition that each cell contains at most one chip, as the grid is already completely filled.; answer: True&#34;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#34;The current sub-tasks are not yielding the correct final answer, indicating that they may not be fully solvable by the corresponding blocks. The main issue seems to be the decomposition and the connection between sub-tasks. The final response is incorrect, suggesting that the architecture might not be effectively capturing the problem&#39;s constraints. The current architecture fails to properly address the intersection of rows and columns, which is crucial for solving the problem correctly.&#34;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks do not fully capture the necessary details to ensure a comprehensive final answer. While they address parts of the problem, they do not adequately connect to ensure that all constraints are considered. Specifically, the handling of overlapping cells in the grid is not appropriately addressed, leading to incorrect conclusions.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#34;The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The current architecture and task decomposition need to be revised to ensure that the final response is accurate and reflects the problem&#39;s constraints.&#34;, &#39;Inappropriate Implementation&#39;: &#39;The current implementation does not effectively guide the agents to the correct solution. The sub-task instructions need to be revised to include known incorrect answers and to better guide the agents through the problem space. This can help avoid repeating past mistakes and improve the final answer.&#39;}

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to refine the task decomposition and the architecture. The previous architecture did not yield the correct final response, so we need to improve the sub-task instructions and ensure they are interconnected more effectively. Additionally, incorporating known incorrect answers into the sub-task instructions can help avoid repeating past mistakes.

Since there are 25 chips of each color and a 5x5 grid, we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of the other color without exceeding the supply of chips or violating the conditions. This would mean filling 5 rows with 5 chips each of one color, using 25 chips, and 5 columns with 5 chips each of the other color, also using 25 chips. Thus, the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5.; answer - 5\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Based on the conditions and the result from Sub-task 1, we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. This means that each row and each column will have exactly one chip at their intersection, which must be the same color as the row and the column. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, and each row and column must have 5 chips, this leads to 25 chips of one color in the rows and 25 chips of the other color in the columns. However, the intersections will be double-counted, as each intersection cell is counted once for the row and once for the column. There are 5 such intersections (one for each row and column pair), so we subtract these 5 from the total, leading to 25 + 25 - 5 = 45 chips in total.; answer - 45\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From the outputs of sub-task 1 and 2, we know that we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of the other color, resulting in a total placement of 45 chips. This placement is optimal because it uses the maximum number of chips without violating the conditions: each row and column having chips of the same color and each cell containing at most one chip. Adding any more chips would require placing an additional chip in a row or column that already has 5 chips, violating the condition. Therefore, the placement is indeed optimal with 45 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.; answer - The placement is optimal with 45 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.&#39;]

Thus, the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5.; answer: 5\nCoT-SC agent RHsm, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: Given that we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of the other color, we must ensure that the intersection of these rows and columns does not double count any chips. Since each row intersects with each column at one cell, there will be 5 intersections, each containing one chip of each color. Therefore, we place 25 chips of one color in the rows, 25 chips of the other color in the columns, and subtract the 5 intersections where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously. Thus, the total number of chips placed is 25 + 25 - 5 = 45.; answer: 45\nCoT-SC agent Koym, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: Based on the previous sub-task, we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. This means each row and each column will intersect exactly once, resulting in one cell being counted twice. Therefore, the total number of chips used will be 5 rows x 5 chips each + 5 columns x 5 chips each - 5 intersections = 25 + 25 - 5 = 45 chips. This is not the 40 chips mentioned in the incorrect statement, but rather 45 chips, as each row and column will have one overlapping chip.; answer: 45\nCoT-SC agent ndb6, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: Based on the conditions and the result from Sub-task 1, we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. This means that each row and each column will have exactly one chip at their intersection, which must be the same color as the row and the column. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, and each row and column must have 5 chips, this leads to 25 chips of one color in the rows and 25 chips of the other color in the columns. However, the intersections will be double-counted, as each intersection cell is counted once for the row and once for the column.

This means each of the 5 rows will have 5 chips of one color, totaling 25 chips, and each of the 5 columns will have 5 chips of the other color, also totaling 25 chips. However, since the grid is 5x5, each cell is shared by a row and a column, so the total number of chips placed is not simply 25 + 25. Instead, each row and column intersection has already been counted once, so we actually place a chip in each of the 25 cells of the grid once, using exactly 25 chips of each color, totaling 25 chips placed.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent hwPC, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: From sub-task 1, we know that we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of the other color. This means we can place 25 chips of one color in 5 rows and 25 chips of the other color in 5 columns. However, this would lead to overlapping at the intersections of rows and columns, where the same cell would be counted twice. Since the grid is 5x5, there are 25 cells in total, and each cell can contain at most one chip. Therefore, the maximum number of chips that can be placed is 25, filling each cell once while maintaining the conditions that all chips in the same row and column have the same color.; answer: 25\nReflexion CoT agent fNjk, on the purpose of verifying optimal placement, thinking: From the outputs of sub-task 1 and 2, we know that we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of the other color, resulting in a total placement of 45 chips.

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#34;The sub-tasks generated in the current architecture are not yielding the correct final answer. The final response, which states that 45 chips can be placed optimally, is incorrect. This suggests that the sub-tasks are not being solved correctly by the corresponding blocks. The issue appears to be with the decomposition and the coordination between sub-tasks, as the problem&#39;s constraints are not being effectively captured.&#34;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks do not fully capture the necessary details to ensure a comprehensive final answer. While they address parts of the problem, they do not adequately connect to ensure that all constraints are considered, particularly the handling of overlapping cells in the grid.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#34;The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The current architecture and task decomposition need to be revised to ensure that the final response is accurate and reflects the problem&#39;s constraints.&#34;, &#39;Inappropriate Implementation&#39;: &#39;The current implementation does not effectively guide the agents to the correct solution. The sub-task instructions need to be revised to include known incorrect answers and to better guide the agents through the problem space. This can help avoid repeating past mistakes and improve the final answer.&#39;}

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to refine the task decomposition and the architecture. The previous architecture did not yield the correct final response, so we need to improve the sub-task instructions and ensure they are interconnected more effectively. Additionally, incorporating known incorrect answers into the sub-task instructions can help avoid repeating past mistakes.

However, to maximize the number of chips placed, we should fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. This will result in a 5x5 grid where each row is filled with one color and each column is filled with the other color. This configuration uses 25 chips of each color, totaling 50 chips.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)

Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?)

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.

All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

The sub-task instructions need to be revised to include known incorrect answers and to better guide the agents through the problem space. This can help avoid repeating past mistakes and improve the final answer.&#39;}

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to refine the task decomposition and the architecture. The previous architecture did not yield the correct final response, so we need to improve the sub-task instructions and ensure they are interconnected more effectively. Additionally, incorporating known incorrect answers into the sub-task instructions can help avoid repeating past mistakes.

If we fill a row with white chips, the entire column must also be white, and vice versa. The maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is determined by the constraints that there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and each row and column must be filled with a single color. The optimal arrangement is to fill 5 rows completely with white chips and 5 columns completely with black chips, or vice versa, which uses all 25 chips of each color without violating any conditions.; answer - 5\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - Based on the previous sub-task, we know that the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5. This means we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. Each row and column contains 5 cells, so filling 5 rows uses 25 chips of one color, and filling 5 columns uses 25 chips of the other color. However, the intersection of these 5 rows and 5 columns is a 5x5 grid, which means the center 5x5 grid is filled twice (once by rows, once by columns). Therefore, the total number of chips placed is 25 (from rows) + 25 (from columns) - 25 (intersection) = 25. This fills the grid optimally with 25 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.; answer - 25\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From the previous sub-tasks, we have established that the optimal placement involves filling 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of the other color. This results in using 25 chips of each color, but the 5x5 intersection grid is counted twice, leading to a total of 25 chips placed. This arrangement satisfies all the conditions, and any attempt to add more chips would either require placing two chips in the same cell or mixing colors in a row or column, both of which violate the given conditions. Therefore, the placement is indeed optimal with 25 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.; answer - The placement is optimal with 25 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.&#39;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent IdXF, on the purpose of determining row and column fills, thinking: To satisfy the conditions, we need to ensure that all chips in the same row and column have the same color. If we fill a row with white chips, the entire column must also be white, and vice versa. The maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is determined by the constraints that there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and each row and column must be filled with a single color. The optimal arrangement is to fill 5 rows completely with white chips and 5 columns completely with black chips, or vice versa, which uses all 25 chips of each color without violating any conditions.; answer: 5\nCoT-SC agent 8kYg, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: Given the constraints, we can fill 5 rows with white chips and 5 columns with black chips. This means we fill a 5x5 grid with one color in each row and a different color in each column, intersecting at a single point in each row and column. The placement is such that each row and each column has exactly one chip of each color, resulting in 25 chips of each color being used. Therefore, the total number of chips that can be placed is the sum of the white chips and black chips used, which is 25 + 25.; answer: 50\nCoT-SC agent g1Wf, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: Based on the conditions, we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with another color, as determined in sub-task 1. Let&#39;s consider filling 5 rows with white chips and 5 columns with black chips. Each row has 5 cells, so filling 5 rows entirely with white chips uses 5 x 5 = 25 white chips. Similarly, each column has 5 cells, so filling 5 columns entirely with black chips uses 5 x 5 = 25 black chips. However, this setup leads to an overlap in the grid where the rows and columns intersect, specifically at a 5x5 section where each intersection cell is counted twice (once for the row and once for the column). Therefore, the total number of distinct chips placed is 5 rows x 5 chips + 5 columns x 5 chips - 5 x 5 intersections = 25 + 25 - 25 = 25 chips placed in total. This is the maximum number of chips that can be placed without violating the conditions.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent c7KD, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: Based on sub-task 1, we know that we can fill 5 rows with white chips and 5 columns with black chips, or vice versa. Each row and column has 5 cells, so filling 5 rows completely uses 5 * 5 = 25 chips of one color. Similarly, filling 5 columns completely uses 5 * 5 = 25 chips of the other color. However, since each intersection of a row and column can only contain one chip, we must subtract the 5 intersections where the rows and columns meet, as each intersection was counted twice (once for the row and once for the column). Thus, the total number of chips is 25 + 25 - 5 = 45.; answer: 45\nCoT-SC agent VI34, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: In the optimal arrangement, we can fill 5 rows with white chips and 5 columns with black chips, or vice versa. Each row and column that is filled uses 5 chips. Thus, filling 5 rows and 5 columns uses 5 * 5 = 25 chips of one color and 5 * 5 = 25 chips of the other color. However, since the grid is 5x5, some intersections will be double-counted. Specifically, the intersection of the 5 rows and 5 columns forms a 5x5 grid, which is exactly the entire grid. Therefore, the total number of chips placed is simply the number of cells in the grid, which is 25.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent Jgtj, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: Based on the previous sub-task, we know that the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5. This means we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. Each row and column contains 5 cells, so filling 5 rows uses 25 chips of one color, and filling 5 columns uses 25 chips of the other color. However, the intersection of these 5 rows and 5 columns is a 5x5 grid, which means the center 5x5 grid is filled twice (once by rows, once by columns). Therefore, the total number of chips placed is 25 (from rows) + 25 (from columns) - 25 (intersection) = 25. This fills the grid optimally with 25 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.; answer: 25\nReflexion CoT agent 0bSY, on the purpose of verifying optimal placement, thinking: From the previous sub-tasks, we have established that the optimal placement involves filling 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of the other color.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To satisfy the conditions, we need to fill some rows and columns with chips of the same color, such that any additional chip would violate the conditions. The maximum number of rows and columns filled with chips of the same color is determined by the maximum square grid that can be filled with one color. Since there are 25 chips of each color, the maximum square that can be filled is a 5x5 grid. Therefore, the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5.; answer - 5\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From the previous sub-task, we know that we can fill up to 5 rows and 5 columns with chips of the same color. To maximize the number of chips placed without violating the conditions, we can fill 4 rows and 4 columns completely with chips of one color, using 16 chips. Then, in the remaining row and column, we can place chips of the opposite color, using another 9 chips (4 in the remaining row and 5 in the remaining column, or vice versa). This gives a total of 16 + 9 = 25 chips. Since each row and column must have chips of the same color, and we cannot add more without violating the conditions, 25 is the maximum number of chips that can be placed.; answer - 25\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From sub-task 1, we determined that a maximum of 5 rows and 5 columns can be filled with chips of the same color. However, sub-task 2 showed that the optimal configuration without violating the conditions is to fill 4 rows and 4 columns completely with one color (16 chips) and then fill the remaining row and column with the opposite color (9 chips), totaling 25 chips. This configuration uses all available chips of one color and maximizes the use of the opposite color without allowing any additional chip placement without violation. Therefore, the placement is indeed optimal with 25 chips, as placing any additional chip would require violating the condition that all chips in the same row and column must be of the same color. The statement that &#39;The placement is optimal with 40 chips&#39; is incorrect, as it does not adhere to the conditions given.; answer - The placement is optimal with 25 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent eaZl, on the purpose of determining row and column fills, thinking: To satisfy the conditions, we need to fill some rows and columns with chips of the same color, such that any additional chip would violate the conditions. The maximum number of rows and columns filled with chips of the same color is determined by the maximum square grid that can be filled with one color. Since there are 25 chips of each color, the maximum square that can be filled is a 5x5 grid. Therefore, the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5.; answer: 5\nCoT-SC agent JkR3, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: The conditions state that all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column must have the same color, and that any additional chip would violate these conditions. From sub-task 1, we know that we can fill a 5x5 grid with chips of the same color. However, to maximize the number of chips placed without violating the conditions, we need to consider placing chips in such a way that additional chips cannot be placed without violating the conditions. If we place 5 rows of one color and 5 columns of the other color, we can fill a 5x5 grid with 25 chips of one color and 15 chips of the other color, totaling 40 chips. This is consistent with the condition that any additional chip would violate the conditions, as placing any more chips would require breaking the row or column color uniformity.; answer: 40\nCoT-SC agent zy8Z, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: To satisfy the conditions, each row and column must have chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. The maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5, as determined in sub-task 1. Therefore, we can fill a 5x5 grid with either all white chips or all black chips, but not both. If we fill a 5x5 grid with one color, we would use 25 chips of that color. Since we have 25 chips of each color, the optimal placement uses all 25 chips of one color, filling the entire grid, and 0 chips of the other color. Thus, the total number of chips placed is 25.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent zus9, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: The problem involves placing chips on a grid such that each row and column contains chips of the same color, and any additional chip placement would violate this condition. From sub-task 1, we know that the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of the same color is 5. This implies that we can fill a 5x5 grid entirely with one color, but since we have 25 white and 25 black chips, we need to consider a balanced placement. A plausible configuration is to fill 4 rows and 4 columns with one color (say white), using 16 chips, and then fill the remaining row and column with the other color (black), using 9 chips. This totals to 16 + 9 = 25 chips of each color, satisfying the constraints.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent UVlb, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: From the previous sub-task, we know that we can fill up to 5 rows and 5 columns with chips of the same color. To maximize the number of chips placed without violating the conditions, we can fill 4 rows and 4 columns completely with chips of one color, using 16 chips. Then, in the remaining row and column, we can place chips of the opposite color, using another 9 chips (4 in the remaining row and 5 in the remaining column, or vice versa). This gives a total of 16 + 9 = 25 chips. Since each row and column must have chips of the same color, and we cannot add more without violating the conditions, 25 is the maximum number of chips that can be placed.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent uAw8, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: To solve this, we need to determine the maximum number of chips that can be placed on the grid such that all chips in the same row and column have the same color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. Since there are 25 white and 25 black chips, and we can fill a maximum of 5 rows and 5 columns with chips of a single color, we can fill a 5x5 grid with one color (either all white or all black). However, to ensure that any additional chip would violate the conditions, we must place 4 rows of one color and 4 columns of the other color, creating a 4x4 grid of one color and a 4x4 grid of the other color, leaving one row and one column unfilled. This results in 16 chips of one color and 16 chips of the other color, totaling 32 chips.; answer: 32\nReflexion CoT agent jKAh, on the purpose of verifying optimal placement, thinking: From sub-task 1, we determined that a maximum of 5 rows and 5 columns can be filled with chips of the same color. However, sub-task 2 showed that the optimal configuration without violating the conditions is to fill 4 rows and 4 columns completely with one color (16 chips) and then fill the remaining row and column with the opposite color (9 chips), totaling 25 chips. This configuration uses all available chips of one color and maximizes the use of the opposite color without allowing any additional chip placement without violation. Therefore, the placement is indeed optimal with 25 chips, as placing any additional chip would require violating the condition that all chips in the same row and column must be of the same color. The statement that &#39;The placement is optimal with 40 chips&#39; is incorrect, as it does not adhere to the conditions given.; answer: The placement is optimal with 25 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.\nCritic agent 9rkF, on the purpose of verifying correctness, thinking: The answer correctly identifies the optimal placement of 25 chips, given the constraints. It explains why placing more than 25 chips would violate the conditions, as each row and column must contain chips of the same color. The statement that the placement is optimal with 40 chips was indeed incorrect, as it would not adhere to the conditions. Therefore, the provided answer is accurate.; answer: True&#34;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to refine the task decomposition and the architecture. The previous architecture did not yield the correct final response, so we need to improve the sub-task instructions and ensure they are interconnected more effectively. Additionally, incorporating known incorrect answers into the sub-task instructions can help avoid repeating past mistakes.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and a 5x5 grid. The maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5 of each. This is because if we fill 5 rows with one color, we can fill 5 columns with the other color, and this will use exactly 25 chips of each color, satisfying the conditions.; answer - 5\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To find the total number of chips that can be placed without violating the conditions, we need to consider the optimal placement where each row and each column has chips of a single color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. From sub-task 1, we determined that we can fill 5 rows entirely with one color and 5 columns entirely with the other color. This means we can fill all cells in 5 rows with white chips and all cells in 5 columns with black chips. However, we need to ensure that any additional chip would violate the conditions. If we fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other, we actually end up filling all 25 cells in the grid, which uses exactly 25 chips of each color. Therefore, the total number of chips that can be placed is 25 + 25 = 50.; answer - 50\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The task requires verifying that the placement of chips is optimal and any additional chip would violate the conditions. From sub-task 1, we know that we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color, using exactly 25 chips of each color. This fills the entire 5x5 grid with 50 chips, satisfying the condition that each row and column has chips of the same color. Since all 25 cells of the grid are filled, adding any more chip would require placing it in a cell that already contains a chip, violating the condition that each cell contains at most one chip. Therefore, the placement of 50 chips is indeed optimal, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.; answer - The placement is optimal with 50 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.&#39;]

agents: [&#39;CoT agent JtOx, on the purpose of determining row and column fills, thinking: To maximize the number of rows and columns filled with chips of a single color, we must ensure that all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color, and that any additional chip would violate these conditions. We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and a 5x5 grid. The maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5 of each. This is because if we fill 5 rows with one color, we can fill 5 columns with the other color, and this will use exactly 25 chips of each color, satisfying the conditions.; answer: 5\nCoT-SC agent ky4Y, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: From sub-task 1, we have determined that we can fill a maximum of 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of the other color. This means we can place 5 white chips in one row, 5 white chips in another row, and so on for 5 rows, using up all 25 white chips. Similarly, we can place 5 black chips in one column, 5 black chips in another column, and so on for 5 columns, using up all 25 black chips. Since each row can intersect with each column only once, this configuration uses exactly 25 chips of each color, totaling 50 chips. This satisfies the conditions without any additional chip placement possible.; answer: 50\nCoT-SC agent PQrX, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: From Sub-task 1, we know that we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. If we fill 5 rows with white chips, we are using 25 white chips. Then, we fill 5 columns with black chips, which also uses 25 black chips. However, since the intersection of these rows and columns is a 5x5 grid, the intersection points (which are 5 in number) will have been double-counted. Therefore, we must subtract these 5 intersection chips from the total count. Thus, the total number of chips placed is 25 (white) + 25 (black) - 5 (intersection) = 45.; answer: 45\nCoT-SC agent PmAy, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: Based on the sub-task 1, we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of the other color. This would mean that each row and each column intersect exactly once, and thus each intersection cell contains one chip of each color. Therefore, the total number of chips placed would be 5 rows times 5 chips per row (of one color) plus 5 columns times 5 chips per column (of the other color), but we must subtract the 5 intersections where a chip is double-counted. Thus, the total number of chips is 5 * 5 + 5 * 5 - 5 = 25 + 25 - 5 = 45.; answer: 45\nCoT-SC agent kHr8, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: From sub-task 1, we know that we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color. This means we can place 5 white chips in one row and 5 black chips in one column, and repeat this for all 5 rows and columns. This results in placing 5 white chips in each of 5 rows (25 white chips) and 5 black chips in each of 5 columns (25 black chips). However, since the colors must be consistent within rows and columns, we can only fill 5 rows and 5 columns completely, leading to 5*5=25 chips of one color and 5*5=25 chips of the other color, but since they overlap in the grid, we actually place 25 chips in total. Therefore, the optimal placement is 25 chips, not 40 as previously stated.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent JnFu, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: To find the total number of chips that can be placed without violating the conditions, we need to consider the optimal placement where each row and each column has chips of a single color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. From sub-task 1, we determined that we can fill 5 rows entirely with one color and 5 columns entirely with the other color. This means we can fill all cells in 5 rows with white chips and all cells in 5 columns with black chips. However, we need to ensure that any additional chip would violate the conditions.

Therefore, the total number of chips that can be placed is 25 + 25 = 50.; answer: 50\nReflexion CoT agent IMGe, on the purpose of verifying optimal placement, thinking: The task requires verifying that the placement of chips is optimal and any additional chip would violate the conditions. From sub-task 1, we know that we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color, using exactly 25 chips of each color.

The placement of 50 chips, 25 white and 25 black, fills the entire 5x5 grid with chips, satisfying all the given conditions.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to refine the task decomposition and the architecture. The previous architecture did not yield the correct final response, so we need to improve the sub-task instructions and ensure they are interconnected more effectively. Additionally, incorporating known incorrect answers into the sub-task instructions can help avoid repeating past mistakes.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To satisfy the conditions, each row and column must be filled with chips of the same color. Since we have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, we can fill 5 rows with white chips and 5 columns with black chips, or vice versa. However, any additional chip would violate the conditions because it would either require a different color in a row or column, or exceed the 25 chips of one color. Thus, the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5 each, either all rows or all columns, but not both.; answer - 5\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of chips placed on the grid without violating the conditions. From sub-task 1, we know we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of another color. This means we can fill 5 rows with white chips and 5 columns with black chips, or vice versa. If we fill 5 rows with white chips, each row having 5 chips, we use 25 white chips. Similarly, if we fill 5 columns with black chips, each column having 5 chips, we use 25 black chips. However, this placement would result in 25 overlapping cells where both a white and a black chip would be placed, which is not allowed. Therefore, the actual placement involves filling either 5 rows or 5 columns, but not both, resulting in a maximum placement of 25 chips of one color, and 15 chips of the other color, totaling 40 chips. This is consistent with the fact that any additional chip would violate the conditions, as it would require placing a chip in a row or column that already has the maximum number of chips of one color. Thus, the total number of chips that can be placed is 25 + 15 = 40.; answer - 40\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The problem involves placing chips on a 5x5 grid with specific constraints: each row and column must have chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. From sub-task 1, we know that we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color, but not both rows and columns completely, due to the limited number of chips. Sub-task 2 suggests a total of 40 chips can be placed without violating the conditions, which implies filling 5 rows with chips of one color and filling 3 columns with chips of the other color, totaling 25 + 15 = 40 chips. If this placement is not optimal, it means that there is a possibility of placing more than 40 chips without violating the conditions. However, given the constraints and the number of chips, placing more than 40 chips would require overlapping chips in some cells, which is not allowed. Therefore, the placement of 40 chips seems optimal under the given constraints, as any additional chip would indeed violate the conditions, either by exceeding the number of available chips or by requiring a different color in a row or column. Thus, the statement &#39;The placement is optimal with 40 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.&#39; is correct.; answer - The placement is optimal with 40 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.&#34;]

Since we have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, we can fill 5 rows with white chips and 5 columns with black chips, or vice versa. However, any additional chip would violate the conditions because it would either require a different color in a row or column, or exceed the 25 chips of one color. Thus, the maximum number of rows and columns that can be filled with chips of a single color is 5 each, either all rows or all columns, but not both.; answer: 5\nCoT-SC agent Pymp, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: To satisfy the conditions, we can fill 5 rows with white chips and 5 columns with black chips, or vice versa. Since each row and column must be filled with chips of the same color, and each cell contains at most one chip, the intersection of a filled row and a filled column will be empty to avoid mixing colors. Thus, we can fill 5 rows with 5 white chips each (25 white chips) and 5 columns with 5 black chips each (25 black chips), but the intersection of these rows and columns will have 5 empty cells (one for each intersection), resulting in 25 + 25 - 5 = 45 chips in total.; answer: 45\nCoT-SC agent xreo, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: Based on sub-task 1, we can fill 5 rows with white chips and 5 columns with black chips. Each row and each column has 5 cells, so filling 5 rows with white chips uses 5 x 5 = 25 white chips, and filling 5 columns with black chips uses 5 x 5 = 25 black chips. However, this would fill the entire grid with 25 white chips and 25 black chips, totaling 50 chips, which exceeds the number of available chips. To find the maximum number of chips without violating the conditions, we need to consider that filling both 5 rows and 5 columns is not possible. Instead, we can fill 4 rows and 4 columns, which will use 4 x 5 = 20 chips of one color and 4 x 5 = 20 chips of another color. Thus, the total number of chips placed is 20 + 20 = 40.; answer: 40\nCoT-SC agent ys6y, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: From sub-task 1, we know that we can fill either 5 rows with one color or 5 columns with one color. If we fill 5 rows with white chips, we use 25 white chips. Then, we can fill 5 columns with black chips, which also uses 25 black chips. This gives us a total of 25 + 25 = 50 chips placed on the grid, filling all 25 cells. This satisfies the condition that each row and column has chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate the conditions because it would require a different color in a row or column, or exceed the 25 chips of one color. Therefore, the total number of chips that can be placed without violating the conditions is 50.; answer: 50\nCoT-SC agent NQfu, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: From the sub-task 1 analysis, we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with another color. This creates a grid where each of the 5 rows intersects with each of the 5 columns, resulting in 5x5 = 25 cells being filled. Thus, the total number of chips placed is 25, which matches the number of cells in the grid, ensuring no more chips can be added without violating the conditions.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent ly1Y, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of chips placed on the grid without violating the conditions. From sub-task 1, we know we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of another color. This means we can fill 5 rows with white chips and 5 columns with black chips, or vice versa. If we fill 5 rows with white chips, each row having 5 chips, we use 25 white chips. Similarly, if we fill 5 columns with black chips, each column having 5 chips, we use 25 black chips. However, this placement would result in 25 overlapping cells where both a white and a black chip would be placed, which is not allowed. Therefore, the actual placement involves filling either 5 rows or 5 columns, but not both, resulting in a maximum placement of 25 chips of one color, and 15 chips of the other color, totaling 40 chips. This is consistent with the fact that any additional chip would violate the conditions, as it would require placing a chip in a row or column that already has the maximum number of chips of one color. Thus, the total number of chips that can be placed is 25 + 15 = 40.; answer: 40\nReflexion CoT agent G03p, on the purpose of verifying optimal placement, thinking: The problem involves placing chips on a 5x5 grid with specific constraints: each row and column must have chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. From sub-task 1, we know that we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color, but not both rows and columns completely, due to the limited number of chips. Sub-task 2 suggests a total of 40 chips can be placed without violating the conditions, which implies filling 5 rows with chips of one color and filling 3 columns with chips of the other color, totaling 25 + 15 = 40 chips. If this placement is not optimal, it means that there is a possibility of placing more than 40 chips without violating the conditions. However, given the constraints and the number of chips, placing more than 40 chips would require overlapping chips in some cells, which is not allowed. Therefore, the placement of 40 chips seems optimal under the given constraints, as any additional chip would indeed violate the conditions, either by exceeding the number of available chips or by requiring a different color in a row or column. Thus, the statement &#39;The placement is optimal with 40 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.&#39; is correct.; answer: The placement is optimal with 40 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.\nCritic agent 2lAP, on the purpose of verifying correctness, thinking: The analysis in the answer seems correct. The placement of 40 chips is indeed optimal given the conditions. Placing 5 rows of one color and 3 columns of another color uses 40 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions, as it would require either mixing colors in a row or column or exceeding the available number of chips.; answer: True&#34;]

final_reponse: [&#34;The problem involves placing chips on a 5x5 grid with specific constraints: each row and column must have chips of the same color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to refine the task decomposition and the architecture. The previous architecture did not yield the correct final response, so we need to improve the sub-task instructions and ensure they are interconnected more effectively. Additionally, incorporating known incorrect answers into the sub-task instructions can help avoid repeating past mistakes.

Each row and column in a 5x5 grid contains 5 cells. If we fill 5 rows with white chips, we use 5x5=25 white chips. Similarly, if we fill 5 columns with black chips, we use 5x5=25 black chips.

When we fill 5 rows with one color, each row has 5 chips, so we use 25 chips of that color. Similarly, filling 5 columns with the other color uses 25 chips of that color. However, this setup would fill the entire grid, which means placing 25 white chips in 5 rows and 25 black chips in 5 columns fills all 25 cells of the grid. Therefore, the maximum total number of chips that can be placed without violating the conditions is 25, not 40 as previously stated.; answer: 25\nCoT-SC agent fbqT, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: In sub-task 1, we determined that we can fill 5 rows with chips of one color and 5 columns with chips of another color. This means we can fill a 5x5 subgrid with chips of one color, and a 5x5 subgrid with chips of another color, but they cannot overlap except at the intersection, which would be empty. Thus, we can place 5 rows * 5 chips = 25 chips of one color, and 5 columns * 5 chips = 25 chips of another color, minus the overlap of 5 chips in the intersection. Therefore, the total number of chips is 25 + 25 - 5 = 45.; answer: 45\nCoT-SC agent g2KH, on the purpose of calculating chip placement, thinking: From sub-task 1, we determined that we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with the other color, which implies that each row and column can intersect at one cell. Thus, we can place 25 chips of one color in 5 rows and 25 chips of the other color in 5 columns. However, since the intersection of these rows and columns will be a 5x5 grid of overlapping cells, only 25 chips can be placed in total without overlap, as each cell can contain at most one chip. Therefore, the maximum number of chips that can be placed is 25.; answer: 25\nReflexion CoT agent si1e, on the purpose of verifying optimal placement, thinking: Based on the outputs of sub-task 1 and 2, the placement of 50 chips is optimal. Sub-task 1 identifies that we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with another color, which uses all 25 chips of each color. Sub-task 2 verifies that this results in 50 chips placed, with each row and column having one overlap, ensuring no additional chips can be added without violating the conditions. Thus, the placement is optimal with 50 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.; answer: The placement is optimal with 50 chips, and any additional chip would violate the conditions.\nCritic agent aaXP, on the purpose of verifying correctness, thinking: The answer correctly identifies that the placement of 50 chips is optimal. By placing 25 chips of one color in all cells of 5 rows and 25 chips of the other color in all cells of 5 columns, each row and column will have one overlap, ensuring no additional chips can be added without violating the conditions.; answer: True&#39;]

final_reponse: [&#39;Based on the outputs of sub-task 1 and 2, the placement of 50 chips is optimal. Sub-task 1 identifies that we can fill 5 rows with one color and 5 columns with another color, which uses all 25 chips of each color.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#34;The current sub-tasks are yielding incorrect final answers. The final response states that 50 chips can be placed optimally, which is not consistent with the problem&#39;s constraints. This suggests that the decomposition or the agents within the blocks are not effectively capturing the problem&#39;s requirements. The sub-tasks are not effectively guiding the agents to the correct solution, indicating a need for further decomposition or improved architecture.&#34;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks do not fully capture all necessary details to ensure a comprehensive final answer. The handling of overlapping cells in the grid is not adequately addressed, leading to incorrect conclusions about the optimal chip placement.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#34;The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The architecture and task decomposition need to be revised to ensure that the final response accurately reflects the problem&#39;s constraints.&#34;, &#39;Inappropriate Implementation&#39;: &#39;The current implementation does not effectively guide the agents to the correct solution. The sub-task instructions need to be revised to include known incorrect answers and to better guide the agents through the problem space. This can help avoid repeating past mistakes and improve the final answer.&#39;}

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to refine the task decomposition and the architecture. The previous architecture did not yield the correct final response, so we need to improve the sub-task instructions and ensure they are interconnected more effectively. Additionally, incorporating known incorrect answers into the sub-task instructions can help avoid repeating past mistakes.
