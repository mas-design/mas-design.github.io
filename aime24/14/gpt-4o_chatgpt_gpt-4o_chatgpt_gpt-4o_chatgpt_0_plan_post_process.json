Previous attempts provided the answer 120 without detailed derivation, indicating possible errors in assumptions or calculations. The problem is complex due to geometric and algebraic constraints, and without detailed steps, it's challenging to confirm the correctness of 120. A step-by-step derivation or additional information on the parametrization and verification is needed to solve this accurately.\n\nAnswer:120\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Verify the parametrization of the hyperbola and ensure the points form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Detailed algebraic and geometric analysis is needed to confirm the greatest possible value of BD^2."
