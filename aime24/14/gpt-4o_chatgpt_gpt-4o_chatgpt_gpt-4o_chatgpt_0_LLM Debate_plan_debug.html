    <pre>Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.

### thinking by Debate Agent dilW:
The hyperbola is defined by the equation \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). For a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the diagonals are conjugate diameters of the hyperbola. The sum of the squares of the semi-axes is \( 20 + 24 = 44 \). The maximum value of \( BD^2 \) occurs when the rhombus is oriented such that the diagonals align with the axes of the hyperbola. Since the maximum \( BD^2 \) must be less than the sum of the squares of the semi-axes, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) is 43.

The hyperbola is given by \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). For a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the diagonals are conjugate diameters of the hyperbola. The sum of the squares of the semi-axes is \( 20 + 24 = 44 \). The maximum value of \( BD^2 \) occurs when the rhombus is oriented such that the diagonals align with the axes of the hyperbola. Since the maximum \( BD^2 \) must be less than the sum of the squares of the semi-axes, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) is 43.
