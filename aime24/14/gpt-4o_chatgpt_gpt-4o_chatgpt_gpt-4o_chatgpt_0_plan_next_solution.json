        "Solvable": "The architecture still struggles with solvability, particularly from sub-task 5 onwards, where the response is marked as <TOO_HARD>. This indicates that the tasks are too complex for the current decomposition, possibly due to inadequate parameterization or insufficient constraints provided to the agents. This points towards a decomposition issue (a).",
        "Completeness": "The sub-tasks attempt to cover necessary aspects of the query but lack thorough exploration of all geometric configurations and constraints. The sub-tasks need to ensure that all critical information is effectively passed to subsequent tasks, which is currently insufficient. The lack of explicit parameter values or constraints is a major gap.",
