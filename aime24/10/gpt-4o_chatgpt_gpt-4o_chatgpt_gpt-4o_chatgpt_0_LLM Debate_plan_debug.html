    <pre>Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?

### thinking by Debate Agent ePpc:
To find the length of CE, we need to consider the collinearity of points D, E, C, and F. Since DC = AB = 107 and EF = 184, and since EF encompasses the entire segment from E to F, we can subtract the portion DC from EF to find CE. Therefore, CE = EF - DC = 184 - 107.

### thinking by Debate Agent DKW4:
Since D, E, C, and F are collinear, the length of CE can be determined by considering the entire line from E to F and subtracting the length of DC. We know DC = AB = 107 and EF = 184. Therefore, CE is the portion of EF that extends beyond DC, so CE = EF - DC = 184 - 107.

    <pre>Both agents agree that since D, E, C, and F are collinear, the length of CE can be determined by considering the segment EF and subtracting the length of DC. Since DC = AB = 107 and EF = 184, the portion of EF that extends beyond DC is CE, which is EF - DC = 184 - 107.
