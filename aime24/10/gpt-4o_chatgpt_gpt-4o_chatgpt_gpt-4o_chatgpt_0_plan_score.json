    "thinking": "Answer ID 0 suggests that CE is the difference between EF and the sum of BC and FG, which is incorrect because it doesn't consider the correct geometric alignment of the rectangles. Answer ID 1 correctly identifies that CE is the sum of BC and FG, as these are the parallel sides that align when D, E, C, F are collinear. Answer ID 2 incorrectly calculates CE by subtracting BC from EF, which misinterprets the relationship between the lengths. Answer ID 3 incorrectly subtracts DC from EF, which assumes DC is parallel to EF, misaligning the geometry. Answer ID 4 and 5 claim that there is insufficient information, which is incorrect as the problem can be solved with given data. Answer ID 6 incorrectly concludes CE as 200, which doesn't align with the logical deduction from the problem constraints. Therefore, Answer ID 1 provides the correct reasoning and final answer.",
