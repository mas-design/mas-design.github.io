    <pre>We are given two rectangles, $ABCD$ and $EFGH$, with certain conditions about collinearity and points on a circle. Specifically, points $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, and points $A, D, H, G$ lie on a circle. We need to find the length of $CE$. 

First, let&#39;s analyze the given information:
- Rectangle $ABCD$ has sides $AB = 107$ and $BC = 16$.
- Rectangle $EFGH$ has sides $FG = 17$ and $EF = 184$.
- Points $D, E, C, F$ are collinear.
- Points $A, D, H, G$ lie on a circle.

The collinearity of $D, E, C, F$ suggests that $E$ and $C$ are on the same line as $D$ and $F$, which means $CE$ is a straight line segment.

Since $D, E, C, F$ are collinear and $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are rectangles, we can infer that $CE$ is parallel to $AD$ and $HF$.

Now, considering the collinearity and the properties of rectangles, we can calculate $CE$ as the sum of $BC$ and $FG$, because $BC$ and $FG$ are the horizontal sides of the rectangles that align when $D, E, C, F$ are collinear.

Thus, the length of $CE$ is the sum of the lengths of $BC$ and $FG$.

$CE = BC + FG = 16 + 17 = 33$.
