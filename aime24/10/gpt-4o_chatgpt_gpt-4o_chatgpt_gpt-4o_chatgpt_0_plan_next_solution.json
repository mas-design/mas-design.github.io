        "1": "The architecture and task decomposition continue to face challenges in reaching a correct solution, as indicated by the <TOO_HARD> tags in the sub-task answers. This suggests that the decomposition is still not sufficient to break down the problem into manageable parts. The suggestions following the <TOO_HARD> tags highlight the need for more specific geometric information or diagrams, indicating that the tasks remain too complex for the current blocks. This points to issue (a), where the task is still too difficult for the block, necessitating further decomposition.\n\nThe agents' outputs reflect a lack of clarity and direction, indicating that the current decomposition does not provide enough specific and detailed instructions. The agents are unable to arrive at a correct or useful answer, showing that the sub-tasks do not include all necessary information or are not connected properly.\n\n2: The current implementation does not effectively utilize the available blocks to solve the task. The sub-tasks lack specificity and do not leverage the strengths of each block. The architecture needs to be revised to include clearer instructions and ensure that all necessary information is provided to each sub-task. By decomposing the tasks further and providing more detailed instructions, the architecture can be improved to yield a better final answer.\n\nFurthermore, the final response remains unchanged and incorrect, as indicated by the fitness score. This suggests that the current architecture and task decomposition are not sufficient to achieve the desired outcome. An updated sub-task instruction is necessary to guide the architecture away from previously incorrect answers, as indicated by the memory.",
        "2": "To improve the architecture, the decomposition must be refined to provide more specific and manageable sub-tasks. The instructions need to ensure that all necessary information is included and that the sub-tasks are connected properly. This will help the agents arrive at a correct and comprehensive final answer. Additionally, the sub-task architecture needs to be revised to better utilize the available blocks and their strengths, ensuring that the agents can effectively solve each sub-task and contribute to the final response."

    "thought": "\n**Further Decomposition:**\nThe previous decomposition attempts did not provide enough detail or specificity for the agents to solve the tasks effectively. The sub-tasks need to be further decomposed as follows:\n\n- Last Sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) New Sub-task 1: Identify and describe the geometric properties of the given rectangles and circle, focusing on the collinearity and cyclic quadrilateral properties.\n\n- Last Sub-task 2 -> (further decompose to) New Sub-task 2: Calculate the positions and distances between points D, E, C, and F, using the given rectangle dimensions and collinearity.\n\n- Last Sub-task 3 -> (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3: Integrate the information from the previous tasks to deduce the length of CE, applying circle properties and geometric reasoning.\n\nThese new sub-tasks are more specific and include detailed steps to guide the agents effectively. By providing clear instructions and ensuring that all necessary information is included, the tasks become more manageable and solvable by the blocks.\n\n**Updated Subtask Instruction:**\nTo guide the architecture away from previously incorrect answers, the last sub-task will include an updated instruction: \"It is known that 201, 0, 200, 217, 300, 184, 168 are not correct.\" This will help the agents avoid these incorrect answers and focus on finding the correct solution.\n\n**Improved Subtask Architecture:**\nThe previous sub-task architecture did not effectively utilize the available blocks. To improve this, the architecture will be revised as follows:\n\n- Last Sub-task Architecture (Chain-of-Thought) (aims to address Sub-task 1) -> (improve to) New Sub-task Architecture (Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought): This utilizes multiple CoT agents with self-consistency to ensure accurate reasoning and calculations.\n\n- Last Sub-task Architecture (Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought) (aims to address Sub-task 2) -> (improve to) New Sub-task Architecture (LLM Debate): This leverages diverse perspectives to integrate findings and deduce the length of CE effectively.\n\nBy revising the architecture to better utilize the strengths of each block and providing clearer instructions, the agents can effectively solve each sub-task and contribute to a correct and comprehensive final answer.",
