    <pre>The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, making it a special type of hexagon called an affine-regular hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. In such a hexagon, the side length of the hexagon is related to the semiperimeter of the triangle formed by the extensions of its sides. The semiperimeter of the triangle is (200 + 240 + 300) / 2 = 370. The side length of the hexagon is equal to the inradius of the triangle formed by these extensions. The area of the triangle can be found using Heron&#39;s formula, and the inradius is the area divided by the semiperimeter. However, in this special configuration, the side length of the hexagon is actually equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the side lengths of the triangle, which is 20.
