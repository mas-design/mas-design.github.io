    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

**Decomposition:**
1. **Sub-task 1:** Identify the properties of the hexagon ABCDEF. Specifically, determine the implications of the hexagon being convex, equilateral, and having pairs of opposite sides parallel. This understanding will help in visualizing and setting up the problem.
2. **Sub-task 2:** Using the properties identified in Sub-task 1, determine how the side lengths of the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF relate to the side length of the hexagon. This involves understanding the geometric configuration and how the triangle&#39;s side lengths (200, 240, and 300) correspond to the hexagon&#39;s dimensions.
3. **Sub-task 3:** Based on the information from Sub-task 2, calculate the side length of the hexagon ABCDEF.

**Overall Architecture:**
To solve the problem, we will utilize the existing blocks in a multi-layered approach:
- **Layer 1:** Use the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) block to address Sub-task 1. This block will help in systematically identifying and understanding the properties of the hexagon.
- **Layer 2:** Use the Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SC) block to address Sub-task 2. This block will allow for multiple reasoning paths to explore the relationship between the triangle and the hexagon, ensuring a robust understanding of how the given side lengths relate to the hexagon.
- **Layer 3:** Use the Reflexion block to address Sub-task 3. This block will iteratively refine the calculation of the hexagon&#39;s side length based on feedback, ensuring accuracy.

**Implementation:**
1. **Layer 1:** Implement the CoT block to handle Sub-task 1. The CoT block will use step-by-step reasoning to understand the properties of the hexagon.
2. **Layer 2:** Implement the CoT-SC block to handle Sub-task 2. The CoT-SC block will generate multiple reasoning paths to explore the relationship between the triangle and hexagon, using majority voting to determine the most likely relationship.
3. **Layer 3:** Implement the Reflexion block to handle Sub-task 3. The Reflexion block will iteratively refine the calculation of the hexagon&#39;s side length, using feedback to improve accuracy.

The architecture ensures that each sub-task is addressed by a block that is well-suited to the complexity and nature of the task, leading to a comprehensive and accurate solution to the problem.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The hexagon ABCDEF is convex, equilateral, and has pairs of opposite sides parallel. Convex means no internal angle is greater than 180 degrees. Equilateral means all sides of the hexagon are equal in length. Having pairs of opposite sides parallel implies the hexagon is symmetric and can be divided into parallelograms. The properties suggest that the hexagon can be decomposed into simpler geometric shapes, such as parallelograms and triangles, which are easier to analyze.; answer - The convex, equilateral hexagon with pairs of opposite sides parallel can be divided into parallelograms or triangles with known properties. This symmetry may help in calculating the side length of the hexagon.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The hexagon is equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal. The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These extensions suggest that the sides of the hexagon are parallel to the sides of the triangle. The side lengths of the triangle are related to the side length of the hexagon through geometric transformations such as translation or rotation. Since the hexagon is equilateral and the triangle is formed by extensions, the side length of the hexagon is related to the proportions of the triangle&#39;s sides. However, without a specific geometric relation or construction, it&#39;s challenging to directly determine the side length of the hexagon from the triangle&#39;s sides alone.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider the geometric relationships and transformations between the hexagon and the triangle.

The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF of the hexagon has sides 200, 240, and 300. This implies that the hexagon&#39;s sides correspond to the differences in these extensions due to their parallel nature. The key is to recognize that the triangle&#39;s sides are proportional to the differences in the hexagon&#39;s side lengths, and by using the triangle inequality and properties of parallel lines, we can deduce the side length of the hexagon. However, determining the exact side length requires solving a system of equations or applying a known formula for such hexagons, which is complex without additional geometric insights or assumptions.; answer - 100\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider using the geometric properties of the hexagon, such as symmetry and parallelism, to set up equations relating the side length of the hexagon to the side lengths of the triangle.

agents: [&#34;CoT agent Ft5e, on the purpose of identifying hexagon properties, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is convex, equilateral, and has pairs of opposite sides parallel. Convex means no internal angle is greater than 180 degrees. Equilateral means all sides of the hexagon are equal in length. Having pairs of opposite sides parallel implies the hexagon is symmetric and can be divided into parallelograms. The properties suggest that the hexagon can be decomposed into simpler geometric shapes, such as parallelograms and triangles, which are easier to analyze.; answer: The convex, equilateral hexagon with pairs of opposite sides parallel can be divided into parallelograms or triangles with known properties. This symmetry may help in calculating the side length of the hexagon.\nCoT agent V8PD, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The hexagon is equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal. The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These extensions suggest that the sides of the hexagon are parallel to the sides of the triangle. The side lengths of the triangle are related to the side length of the hexagon through geometric transformations such as translation or rotation. Since the hexagon is equilateral and the triangle is formed by extensions, the side length of the hexagon is related to the proportions of the triangle&#39;s sides. However, without a specific geometric relation or construction, it&#39;s challenging to directly determine the side length of the hexagon from the triangle&#39;s sides alone.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider the geometric relationships and transformations between the hexagon and the triangle. Analyze how the parallel and equal sides of the hexagon correspond to the triangle&#39;s sides and their extensions.\nCoT agent EALP, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, indicating it can be divided into parallelograms or triangles. The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These extensions suggest a relationship between the sides of the hexagon and the triangle. Since ABCDEF is equilateral, the side length of the hexagon should be related to the dimensions of this triangle. Typically, a hexagon with these properties can be divided into two congruent equilateral triangles and a parallelogram, or other symmetrical shapes. However, the exact method to relate the triangle&#39;s side lengths to the hexagon&#39;s side length is not immediately clear without additional geometric analysis.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider using vector analysis or coordinate geometry to establish a relationship between the triangle&#39;s side lengths and the hexagon&#39;s side length, or look for a geometric transformation that relates the two shapes.\nCoT agent Ml3y, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These are the distances between the parallel sides of the hexagon. For a regular hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being made up of several parallelograms. The side length of the hexagon is related to the distances between these parallel lines. In this case, the triangle&#39;s sides correspond to these distances, and the side length of the hexagon is directly related to them.; answer: 100\nCoT agent EGdX, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The hexagon is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, meaning it can be divided into parallelograms or triangles. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These sides are related to the differences in direction of the vectors representing the sides of the hexagon. The side lengths of the triangle are proportional to the differences in direction of the parallel sides of the hexagon. The problem can be further simplified by considering the hexagon as composed of three parallelograms, each contributing to one side of the triangle. The side length of the hexagon is related to these differences.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider the geometric relationship between the sides of the triangle and the hexagon. Use the fact that the triangle is formed by the differences in direction of the hexagon&#39;s sides to relate the triangle&#39;s side lengths to the hexagon&#39;s side length.\nCoT agent m5J6, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These segments are extensions of the sides of the hexagon, which means each side of the hexagon is parallel to one side of the triangle. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal. The problem is similar to finding the side length of a regular hexagon inscribed in a triangle formed by the extensions of its sides. The side length of the hexagon is related to the semi-perimeter of the triangle, which is (200 + 240 + 300)/2 = 370. The side length of the hexagon is the radius of the circle inscribed in this triangle, which is the area of the triangle divided by the semi-perimeter. However, without additional information or a specific formula to relate the side lengths directly, the problem becomes complex.; answer: 100\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: The problem can be simplified by considering the triangle formed by the extensions as a reference to find a direct relation between the side length of the hexagon and the given triangle&#39;s dimensions. Further geometric properties or a specific formula relating the triangle&#39;s sides to the hexagon&#39;s side length are needed.\nCoT agent OReb, on the purpose of calculating hexagon side length, thinking: The problem involves a special type of hexagon called a &#39;parallelogram hexagon&#39;, where opposite sides are parallel and equal. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF of the hexagon has sides 200, 240, and 300. This implies that the hexagon&#39;s sides correspond to the differences in these extensions due to their parallel nature. The key is to recognize that the triangle&#39;s sides are proportional to the differences in the hexagon&#39;s side lengths, and by using the triangle inequality and properties of parallel lines, we can deduce the side length of the hexagon. However, determining the exact side length requires solving a system of equations or applying a known formula for such hexagons, which is complex without additional geometric insights or assumptions.; answer: 100\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider using the geometric properties of the hexagon, such as symmetry and parallelism, to set up equations relating the side length of the hexagon to the side lengths of the triangle. Alternatively, research known results for equilateral hexagons with parallel opposite sides.\nCritic agent vGDX, on the purpose of reviewing calculation, thinking: The answer provided by the Chain-of-Thought Agent OReb is 100, which is indeed the correct side length for the hexagon. The reasoning involves recognizing that the extensions of the sides of the hexagon form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. Due to the properties of this special hexagon, the side length is half the length of the longest side of the triangle formed by the extensions. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 100.; answer: True&#34;]

final_reponse: [&#34;The problem involves a special type of hexagon called a &#39;parallelogram hexagon&#39;, where opposite sides are parallel and equal. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF of the hexagon has sides 200, 240, and 300.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable**: The sub-tasks are not fully solvable as indicated by the presence of &#39;&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;&#39; in the sub-task answers. This suggests that the decomposition is inadequate, and the tasks remain too complex for the blocks. For instance, Sub-task 2&#39;s answer shows that the relationship between the triangle and the hexagon is not fully understood, and Sub-task 3&#39;s answer indicates a lack of clarity in calculating the hexagon&#39;s side length. The suggestions provided after &#39;&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;&#39; need to be incorporated into a more detailed decomposition. 

(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not cover all necessary information from the original query comprehensively. The connections between sub-tasks are not clearly defined, leading to an incomplete understanding of how each sub-task contributes to the final answer. The instructions for each sub-task need to be more explicit in defining dependencies and ensuring that all critical information is included.

(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This is primarily due to the insufficient decomposition and the lack of clear connections between sub-tasks. The final response does not effectively aggregate the sub-task responses to yield a correct answer. The architecture needs to be revised to address these issues.

thought: 
**Further Decomposition**:
1. **Last sub-task 1 -&gt;** (further decompose to) **New sub-task 1.1**: Identify and list all geometric properties of the hexagon ABCDEF, including convexity, equilateral nature, and parallel opposite sides. Explain how these properties influence the geometric configuration of the hexagon.
2. **New sub-task 1.2**: Based on the properties identified in Sub-task 1.1, determine the geometric relationship between the hexagon and the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Explore how the given side lengths of the triangle relate to the hexagon&#39;s dimensions.
3. **New sub-task 1.3**: Calculate the side length of the hexagon using the relationships identified in Sub-task 1.2. Ensure that all necessary geometric principles and equations are applied to derive the correct side length.

**Improved Subtask Architecture**:
1. **Last sub-task architecture (Reflexion for Sub-task 3) -&gt;** (improve to) **New sub-task architecture (LLM Debate for Sub-task 3)**: The Reflexion block was not optimal for Sub-task 3 as it failed to refine the calculation effectively. Switching to an LLM Debate block will allow multiple agents to debate and refine the calculation collaboratively, leading to a more accurate final answer. This change leverages diverse perspectives to improve the solution quality.

**Updated Subtask Instruction**:
For Sub-task 3, add: &#34;It is known that (100) is not correct.&#34; This will guide the sub-architecture to avoid repeating previously incorrect answers.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1.1 output: thinking - The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral, meaning all its sides are of equal length. It is also convex, ensuring that all interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and all vertices point outwards. The property that opposite sides are parallel means that each pair of opposite sides, such as AB and DE, are parallel to each other. These properties suggest that the hexagon is symmetric and can be inscribed in a circle. The problem also involves a triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF, with given side lengths. This triangle helps determine the side length of the hexagon by using the relationship between the triangle&#39;s side lengths and the hexagon&#39;s symmetry and parallel properties.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider the geometric configuration of the hexagon and how the given triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300 relates to the hexagon. Use properties of parallel lines and equilateral hexagons to find relationships between the triangle and hexagon side lengths.\nSub-task 1.2 output: thinking - The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has parallel opposite sides, which implies it could be part of a symmetric geometric configuration. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF with sides 200, 240, and 300 is related to the hexagon. The triangle&#39;s side lengths suggest it is a scaled version of a triangle formed by the hexagon&#39;s extensions, possibly using properties of parallel lines and symmetry. The hexagon&#39;s side length can be determined by analyzing this relationship.; answer - 120\nSub-task 1.3 output: thinking - The problem involves a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, and a triangle formed by the extensions of its sides with given side lengths.

agents: [&#34;CoT agent R5jL, on the purpose of identifying hexagon properties, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral, meaning all its sides are of equal length. It is also convex, ensuring that all interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and all vertices point outwards. The property that opposite sides are parallel means that each pair of opposite sides, such as AB and DE, are parallel to each other.

The problem also involves a triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF, with given side lengths. This triangle helps determine the side length of the hexagon by using the relationship between the triangle&#39;s side lengths and the hexagon&#39;s symmetry and parallel properties.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider the geometric configuration of the hexagon and how the given triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300 relates to the hexagon. Use properties of parallel lines and equilateral hexagons to find relationships between the triangle and hexagon side lengths.\nCoT agent AStx, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has parallel opposite sides, which implies it could be part of a symmetric geometric configuration. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF with sides 200, 240, and 300 is related to the hexagon. The triangle&#39;s side lengths suggest it is a scaled version of a triangle formed by the hexagon&#39;s extensions, possibly using properties of parallel lines and symmetry. The hexagon&#39;s side length can be determined by analyzing this relationship.; answer: 120\nCoT agent 3KIm, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral with all sides equal and opposite sides parallel. This configuration implies that the hexagon can be decomposed into overlapping equilateral triangles. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300, which suggests a relationship with the hexagon&#39;s geometry. The triangle&#39;s sides can be seen as differences between the hexagon&#39;s side extensions. Using properties of parallel lines and the fact that the triangle is formed by extensions, we can deduce a relationship between the side lengths of the triangle and the hexagon.; answer: The side length of the hexagon is 100.\nCoT agent 4hSD, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has parallel opposite sides, suggesting a symmetric configuration. The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These side lengths correspond to the distances between the parallel sides of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, its side length can be determined by analyzing the geometric relationship between the triangle and the hexagon. However, the problem is complex due to the involvement of parallel lines and the need to relate the triangle&#39;s sides to the hexagon&#39;s side length.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider decomposing the problem further by analyzing the relationship between the distances given by the triangle&#39;s sides and the side length of the hexagon. Use properties of parallel lines and symmetry to find a direct relation between the triangle&#39;s side lengths and the hexagon&#39;s side length.\nCoT agent Dyxc, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The problem involves a convex equilateral hexagon with parallel opposite sides and a triangle formed by the extensions of certain sides. The triangle&#39;s side lengths are given, and these relate to the hexagon&#39;s side length. The hexagon&#39;s symmetry and parallel properties suggest a specific geometric relationship between the triangle and hexagon. However, without additional information on how the triangle&#39;s side lengths directly relate to the hexagon&#39;s dimensions, the problem remains complex. The triangle&#39;s side lengths suggest a possible scaling or proportional relationship with the hexagon&#39;s side length, but determining this requires further decomposition or information.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Further decompose the problem by exploring the specific geometric relationship between the hexagon&#39;s symmetry, parallel sides, and the triangle&#39;s side lengths. Consider using geometric transformations or coordinate geometry to establish a direct relationship.\nCoT agent s5Cc, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel. This configuration suggests that the hexagon is symmetric and can be inscribed in a circle. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF with sides 200, 240, and 300 is related to the hexagon&#39;s geometry. The parallel nature of opposite sides suggests that the triangle&#39;s sides are related to the distances between parallel lines. The side lengths of the triangle can be used to find the side length of the hexagon, but the exact relationship requires further exploration of the geometric configuration and properties of the hexagon.; answer: 100\nDebate agent 1DvX, round 0, on the purpose of calculating hexagon side length, thinking: The problem involves a geometric relationship between a hexagon and a triangle formed by extensions of its sides. The triangle&#39;s side lengths are 200, 240, and 300, which suggest a scaling factor or geometric transformation that relates to the hexagon. The hexagon&#39;s properties of having all pairs of opposite sides parallel and being equilateral imply symmetry that can be leveraged to find the side length. Based on the previous analysis, the side length of the hexagon was determined to be 120, which aligns with the geometric configuration and scaling from the triangle to the hexagon.; answer: 120\nDebate agent foof, round 0, on the purpose of calculating hexagon side length, thinking: The problem involves a geometric relationship between a hexagon and a triangle formed by its extensions. The triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300 is related to the hexagon through scaling due to parallel and equilateral properties. The side length of the hexagon can be found by considering the scaling factor between the triangle and the hexagon. The given sub-task suggests a side length of 120, which indicates a specific proportional relationship due to geometric symmetry and parallelism. If the triangle is a scaled version of a smaller triangle formed by the hexagon, then the side length of the hexagon should be consistent with the scaling factor derived from the triangle&#39;s side lengths.; answer: 120\nDebate agent 1DvX, round 1, on the purpose of calculating hexagon side length, thinking: The problem involves finding the side length of a hexagon based on the properties of a related triangle. The triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300, which suggests a specific geometric relationship. The hexagon is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, which implies symmetry and scaling. Previous analyses suggest a side length of 120 for the hexagon, which aligns with the geometric properties and scaling from the triangle to the hexagon. This conclusion is consistent with the geometric configuration and previously identified relationships.; answer: 120\nDebate agent foof, round 1, on the purpose of calculating hexagon side length, thinking: The problem involves understanding the relationship between the equilateral hexagon and the triangle formed by the extensions of its sides. Given the side lengths of the triangle (200, 240, 300), we can infer a scaling relationship due to the hexagon&#39;s symmetry and parallel properties. The previous analysis suggests a side length of 120 for the hexagon, which aligns with the geometric configuration and scaling from the triangle to the hexagon. The side length of the hexagon should be consistent with the scaling factor derived from the triangle&#39;s side lengths.; answer: 120\nDebate agent 1DvX, round 2, on the purpose of calculating hexagon side length, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, meaning it can be divided into three parallelograms. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. The key observation is that the side length of the hexagon is related to these triangle sides. Given the equilateral and parallel properties, each side of the hexagon is proportional to the sides of the triangle. The correct side length that fits these geometric constraints is 120, as this maintains the symmetry and proportionality between the hexagon and the triangle.; answer: 120\nDebate agent foof, round 2, on the purpose of calculating hexagon side length, thinking: The problem involves a convex equilateral hexagon with parallel opposite sides, and a triangle formed by the extensions of its sides with known side lengths. The side lengths of the triangle (200, 240, 300) suggest a specific geometric relationship and scaling factor due to the symmetry and parallel properties of the hexagon. Previous analyses have consistently concluded that the side length of the hexagon is 120, which aligns with the geometric configuration and scaling from the triangle to the hexagon.; answer: 120\nDebate agent 1DvX, round 3, on the purpose of calculating hexagon side length, thinking: The problem involves a convex equilateral hexagon with parallel opposite sides, and a triangle formed by the extensions of its sides with known side lengths.

Previous analyses have consistently concluded that the side length of the hexagon is 120, which aligns with the geometric configuration and scaling from the triangle to the hexagon.; answer: 120\nDebate agent foof, round 3, on the purpose of calculating hexagon side length, thinking: The problem involves finding the side length of a convex equilateral hexagon with parallel opposite sides, given a related triangle with known side lengths. The triangle&#39;s sides (200, 240, 300) suggest a scaling factor due to the symmetry and parallel properties of the hexagon. Previous analyses have determined that the side length of the hexagon is 120, as this value satisfies the geometric configuration and proportionality between the hexagon and the triangle.; answer: 120\nDebate agent 1DvX, round 4, on the purpose of calculating hexagon side length, thinking: The problem involves a convex equilateral hexagon with parallel opposite sides, and a triangle formed by the extensions of its sides with known side lengths (200, 240, 300). The geometric relationship between the hexagon and the triangle indicates a scaling factor due to symmetry and parallel properties. Previous analyses have consistently concluded that the side length of the hexagon is 120, which aligns with the geometric configuration and scaling from the triangle to the hexagon.; answer: 120\nDebate agent foof, round 4, on the purpose of calculating hexagon side length, thinking: The problem involves understanding the geometric relationship between a convex equilateral hexagon and a triangle formed by the extensions of its sides. Given the side lengths of the triangle (200, 240, 300) and the symmetry and parallel properties of the hexagon, previous analyses have consistently determined the side length of the hexagon to be 120. This value satisfies the proportionality and geometric configuration between the triangle and the hexagon.; answer: 120\nFinal Decision agent, on the purpose of finalizing hexagon side length, thinking: The problem involves a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, and a triangle formed by the extensions of its sides with given side lengths.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable**: The sub-tasks are not entirely solvable as evidenced by the presence of &#39;&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;&#39; in some answers, particularly in Sub-task 1.1. This indicates that the decomposition is still not detailed enough for the blocks to handle effectively. The suggestions provided after &#39;&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;&#39; should be incorporated into a more granular decomposition. Additionally, the final response of 120 for the hexagon&#39;s side length is incorrect, suggesting that the task decomposition or agent architecture isn&#39;t adequately addressing the problem.

(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks need to ensure that all necessary information from the original query is included and that the connections between sub-tasks are clearly defined. The current decomposition fails to fully address how the triangle&#39;s side lengths relate to the hexagon&#39;s side length, leading to an incomplete solution.

(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This is primarily due to the insufficient decomposition and the lack of clear connections between sub-tasks. The architecture needs to be revised to address these issues.

To improve, I suggest further decomposing the tasks based on the suggestions provided and ensuring that the sub-tasks are more detailed and specific. Additionally, updating the sub-task instructions to avoid known incorrect answers could help guide the architecture towards a correct solution.

thought: 
**Further Decomposition**:
1. **Last sub-task 1.1 -&gt;** (further decompose to) **New sub-task 1.1.1**: Identify and explain the geometric properties of the hexagon ABCDEF, including convexity and equilateral nature, without focusing on parallel sides yet.
2. **New sub-task 1.1.2**: Analyze the implications of having parallel opposite sides in the hexagon and how this affects its geometric configuration.
3. **New sub-task 1.2**: Based on the properties identified in Sub-task 1.1.1 and 1.1.2, determine the geometric relationship between the hexagon and the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Explore how the given side lengths of the triangle relate to the hexagon&#39;s dimensions.
4. **New sub-task 1.3**: Calculate the side length of the hexagon using the relationships identified in Sub-task 1.2. Ensure that all necessary geometric principles and equations are applied to derive the correct side length.

**Improved Subtask Architecture**:
1. **Last sub-task architecture (LLM Debate for Sub-task 1.3) -&gt;** (improve to) **New sub-task architecture (Self-Refine for Sub-task 1.3)**: Switching to a Self-Refine block will allow iterative refinement of the calculation based on feedback, which can help in correcting errors and achieving a more accurate final answer.

**Updated Subtask Instruction**:
For Sub-task 1.3, add: &#34;It is known that (100, 120, 150, 20, 60, 40) are not correct.&#34; This will guide the sub-architecture to avoid repeating previously incorrect answers.

Additionally, each pair of opposite sides is parallel, which suggests that the hexagon is centrally symmetric.

The side lengths of this triangle (200, 240, and 300) are related to the distances between non-adjacent vertices of the hexagon.

agents: [&#34;CoT agent ZeM9, on the purpose of identifying hexagon properties, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is convex and equilateral, meaning all its sides are of equal length. Additionally, each pair of opposite sides is parallel, which suggests that the hexagon is centrally symmetric. The problem states that the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. This implies that the hexagon has a special geometric configuration that allows such a triangle to exist from the extensions of these segments.; answer: The hexagon is convex and equilateral with all sides equal and opposite sides parallel, indicating symmetry and equal angles between adjacent sides.\nCoT agent ne6A, on the purpose of analyzing parallel sides, thinking: Having parallel opposite sides in the hexagon implies that the hexagon is centrally symmetric, which is a key property of equilateral hexagons with opposite sides parallel. This symmetry ensures that the hexagon can be inscribed in a circle, and it also means that the extensions of the sides (like AB, CD, and EF) form a triangle outside the hexagon.

This configuration implies that the hexagon can be inscribed in a circle, and the extensions of AB, CD, and EF form a triangle outside the hexagon. The sides of this triangle (200, 240, 300) are essentially the distances between certain non-adjacent vertices of the hexagon. For a centrally symmetric hexagon, the distances between such vertices are related to the side length of the hexagon itself. Specifically, these distances form a triangle whose sides are proportional to the side length of the hexagon. For a regular hexagon with side length s, the distance between two opposite vertices is s√3. Given that the triangle sides are 200, 240, and 300, we can assume these correspond to s√3 in some proportional manner. Solving for s using these distances provides the side length of the hexagon.; answer: 100\nCoT agent QMvx, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral with all sides equal, and opposite sides are parallel, making it centrally symmetric. The extensions of AB, CD, and EF form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is known as the triangle of diagonals of the hexagon, where each side of the triangle corresponds to the sum of the lengths of the two diagonals of the hexagon that are parallel to each other. Since the hexagon is equilateral and centrally symmetric, it can be divided into six equilateral triangles. Each diagonal of the hexagon is twice the side length of the hexagon. Therefore, the side lengths of the triangle formed by the extensions are twice the side length of the hexagon. By solving the system of equations based on the given triangle side lengths, we find the side length of the hexagon.; answer: 60\nCoT agent JbNp, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The hexagon is equilateral and has parallel opposite sides, which implies it is centrally symmetric. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is known as the excentral triangle of the hexagon, and its sides are related to the distances between non-adjacent vertices of the hexagon. The side lengths of the triangle are equal to the sum of the side lengths of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side of the hexagon is equal to one-third of the sum of the triangle&#39;s sides.; answer: 80\nCoT agent jRtX, on the purpose of relating triangle and hexagon, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and has parallel opposite sides, which makes it centrally symmetric.

The extensions of AB, CD, and EF form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. The side lengths of this triangle are related to the distances between non-adjacent vertices of the hexagon. By considering the properties of a centrally symmetric equilateral hexagon, we can deduce that the side length of the hexagon is related to the semi-perimeter of the triangle formed by the extensions. The semi-perimeter of the triangle is (200 + 240 + 300) / 2 = 370. For a centrally symmetric equilateral hexagon, the side length is one-third of the semi-perimeter of the triangle formed by the extensions, which gives us 370 / 3.; answer: 123\nCoT agent VVBx, on the purpose of calculating hexagon side length, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is an equilateral hexagon with parallel opposite sides, which means it is centrally symmetric. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These side lengths represent the distances between the non-adjacent vertices of the hexagon due to its symmetry. The side length of the hexagon can be found by recognizing that these distances are twice the side length of the hexagon, as they form a parallelogram with the hexagon&#39;s sides. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is half of the greatest common divisor of the triangle&#39;s side lengths 200, 240, and 300.; answer: 60\nCritic agent G4Oi, on the purpose of reviewing calculation, thinking: The reasoning provided in the answer suggests that the side length of the hexagon is half of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the triangle&#39;s side lengths 200, 240, and 300. However, this reasoning is flawed. The side lengths of the triangle do not directly correspond to twice the side length of the hexagon. The hexagon is equilateral, and the triangle formed by extensions of AB, CD, and EF is related to the hexagon&#39;s geometry, but the side length of the hexagon is not simply half the GCD of the triangle&#39;s side lengths. The correct approach involves understanding the geometric properties of the hexagon and its symmetry, and how the triangle&#39;s side lengths relate to the distances between certain vertices of the hexagon.; answer: False\nCoT agent VVBx, on the purpose of refining calculation, thinking: The hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral with parallel opposite sides, meaning it is a centrally symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. These side lengths represent the distances between specific non-adjacent vertices of the hexagon due to its symmetry.

Therefore, the correct side length of the hexagon is 60.; answer: 60\nCritic agent G4Oi, on the purpose of reviewing calculation, thinking: The reasoning provided is correct. The hexagon is centrally symmetric with parallel opposite sides, and the triangle&#39;s side lengths are the distances between non-adjacent vertices. The greatest common divisor of the triangle&#39;s side lengths (200, 240, 300) is indeed 20, and dividing by 2 gives the hexagon&#39;s side length as 60. Therefore, the answer is correct.; answer: True&#34;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable**: The sub-tasks have been further decomposed, which appears to make them more manageable for the blocks. However, the final answer of 60 is incorrect, indicating that while the decomposition has improved, it still does not fully solve the problem. The presence of incorrect answers suggests that either the decomposition is still too complex, or the blocks are not optimally configured to solve the sub-tasks. In particular, Sub-task 1.3 needs further refinement as it is still producing incorrect results.

(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks appear to cover the necessary information from the original query, but the connection between sub-tasks may need to be strengthened to ensure that the final answer is derived correctly. The instructions should ensure that all necessary geometric relationships are fully explored and that the sub-tasks are well-linked.

(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. To improve the fitness score, further refinement of the sub-task decomposition and architecture is necessary. This includes ensuring that the sub-tasks are clearly connected and that the final response avoids previously incorrect answers.

thought: 
**Further Decomposition**:
1. **Last sub-task 1.3 -&gt;** (further decompose to) **New sub-task 1.3.1**: Calculate the distances between non-adjacent vertices of the hexagon using the triangle&#39;s side lengths and determine how these distances relate to the hexagon&#39;s side length.
2. **New sub-task 1.3.2**: Based on the distances calculated in Sub-task 1.3.1, derive the side length of the hexagon using geometric principles and ensure that known incorrect answers are avoided.

**Improved Subtask Architecture**:
1. **Last sub-task architecture (Self-Refine for Sub-task 1.3) -&gt;** (improve to) **New sub-task architecture (LLM Debate for Sub-task 1.3.2)**: Switching to an LLM Debate block for Sub-task 1.3.2 will allow multiple agents to debate and refine the calculation collaboratively, leading to a more accurate final answer. This change leverages diverse perspectives to improve the solution quality.

**Updated Subtask Instruction**:
For Sub-task 1.3.2, add: &#34;It is known that (100, 120, 150, 20, 60, 40) are not correct.&#34; This will guide the sub-architecture to avoid repeating previously incorrect answers.

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable**: The current architecture&#39;s sub-tasks are not fully solvable as indicated by the presence of &#39;&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;&#39; in several sub-task answers, especially in Sub-tasks 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and 1.3.2. This suggests that the decomposition is still inadequate, and the tasks remain too complex for the blocks. The suggestions provided after &#39;&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;&#39; need to be incorporated into a more detailed decomposition. Additionally, the final response of 140 is incorrect, indicating that the task decomposition or agent architecture isn&#39;t adequately addressing the problem.

(2) **Completeness**: The sub-tasks do not cover all necessary information from the original query comprehensively. The connections between sub-tasks are not clearly defined, leading to an incomplete understanding of how each sub-task contributes to the final answer. The instructions for each sub-task need to be more explicit in defining dependencies and ensuring that all critical information is included.

(3) **Fitness**: The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This is primarily due to the insufficient decomposition and the lack of clear connections between sub-tasks. The architecture needs to be revised to address these issues.

To improve, I suggest further decomposing the tasks based on the suggestions provided and ensuring that the sub-tasks are more detailed and specific. Additionally, updating the sub-task instructions to avoid known incorrect answers could help guide the architecture towards a correct solution.

thought: 
**Further Decomposition**:
1. **Last sub-task 1.1.1 -&gt;** (further decompose to) **New sub-task 1.1.1.1**: Identify the basic geometric properties of the hexagon ABCDEF, focusing on its equilateral nature.
2. **New sub-task 1.1.1.2**: Determine how the equilateral nature of the hexagon influences its geometric configuration.
3. **Last sub-task 1.1.2 -&gt;** (further decompose to) **New sub-task 1.1.2.1**: Analyze the implications of having parallel opposite sides in the hexagon.
4. **New sub-task 1.1.2.2**: Explore how the parallel nature affects the overall symmetry and potential inscribability in a circle.
5. **Last sub-task 1.3.2 -&gt;** (further decompose to) **New sub-task 1.3.2.1**: Establish a geometric relationship between the side lengths of the triangle and the distances between non-adjacent vertices of the hexagon using vector analysis or coordinate geometry.
6. **New sub-task 1.3.2.2**: Based on the relationship established in Sub-task 1.3.2.1, calculate the side length of the hexagon, avoiding known incorrect answers.

**Improved Subtask Architecture**:
1. **Last sub-task architecture (LLM Debate for Sub-task 1.3.2) -&gt;** (improve to) **New sub-task architecture (Self-Refine for Sub-task 1.3.2.2)**: Switching to a Self-Refine block for Sub-task 1.3.2.2 will allow iterative refinement of the calculation based on feedback, which can help in correcting errors and achieving a more accurate final answer.

**Updated Subtask Instruction**:
For Sub-task 1.3.2.2, add: &#34;It is known that (100, 120, 150, 20, 60, 40, 140) are not correct.&#34; This will guide the sub-architecture to avoid repeating previously incorrect answers.
