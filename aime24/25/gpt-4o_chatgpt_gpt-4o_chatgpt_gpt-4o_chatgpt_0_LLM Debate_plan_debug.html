    <pre>Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.

### thinking by Debate Agent 0Leq:
The hexagon is equilateral and has pairs of parallel sides, suggesting a symmetric structure. The triangle formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has sides in the ratio 5:6:7, which corresponds to a 5-6-7 triangle, a common geometric configuration. The side lengths of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300, which are proportional to 5, 6, and 7, respectively. The common difference between the side lengths of the triangle is 40, indicating a potential link to the hexagon&#39;s side length. Since the hexagon&#39;s structure is symmetric and equilateral, the side length of the hexagon is likely related to this common difference, leading to the conclusion that the side length of the hexagon is 40.

### thinking by Debate Agent FT6h:
The hexagon is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, forming a symmetric structure. The side lengths of the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF are in the ratio 5:6:7. This suggests a proportional relationship between the triangle and the hexagon. The common difference in the side lengths of the triangle is 40, which indicates that the side length of the hexagon is 40.
