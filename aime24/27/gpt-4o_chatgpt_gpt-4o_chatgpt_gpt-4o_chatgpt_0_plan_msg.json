Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)\n\nYour objective is to \n\n(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like 'output exactly the following...' is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.\n\nMake sure \n\n(a) Include sub-task ID  and 'Based on (task i)' in the instruction of a sub-task. \nFor example, \nSimilarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2's instruction should be\n'Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1's instruction)'\n\nSimilarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3's instruction should be\n'Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3's instruction)'\nThis helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task \nFor example,\n`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`\nYou can see it clearly states 'based on what sub-tasks'\n\n(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. \n\n(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. \nYou should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.\n\nFor example, if the exising architectures are 'COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate' and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:\n\nExample Setup\n\nResulting sub-tasks:\nsub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4\n\nAvailable architectures:\nCOT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate\n\nNetwork with 3 Layers:\n\nLayer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  \nLayer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   \nLayer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  \n\nConnection Strategies:\n\n1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.\nExample: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -> [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)\n\n2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.\nExample: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -> [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -> [COT -> Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -> Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\n1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.\n\n2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. \n\nYour aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the 'code' entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\n\n\n# The utility code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom typing import Union\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\n\nimport openai\nimport backoff\nfrom utils import random_id\n\n# Initialize the OpenAI client\nclient = openai.OpenAI()\n\n# Named tuple for holding task information\nInfo = namedtuple('Info', ['name', 'author', 'content', 'prompt', 'sub_tasks', 'agents', 'iteration_idx'])\n\n# Format instructions for LLM response\nFORMAT_INST = lambda request_keys: f\"Reply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{str(request_keys)}\nDO NOT MISS ANY FIELDS AND MAKE SURE THE JSON FORMAT IS CORRECT!\n\"\n\n# Description of the role for the LLM\nROLE_DESC = lambda role: f\"You are a {role}.\"\n\n@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, openai.RateLimitError)\ndef get_json_response_from_gpt(msg, model, system_message, temperature=0.5):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to get JSON response from GPT model.\n    \n    Args:\n    - msg (str): The user message.\n    - model (str): The model to use.\n    - system_message (str): The system message.\n    - temperature (float): Sampling temperature.\n    \n    Returns:\n    - dict: The JSON response.\n    \"\"\"\n    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_message},\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": msg},\n        ],\n        temperature=temperature,\n        max_tokens=1024,\n        stop=None,\n        response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n    )\n    content = response.choices[0].message.content\n    json_dict = json.loads(content)\n    return json_dict\n\nclass LLMAgentBase():\n    \"\"\"\n    Attributes:\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, output_fields: list, agent_name: str,\n                 role='helpful assistant', model=None, temperature=None) -> None:\n        self.output_fields = output_fields\n        self.agent_name = agent_name\n\n        self.role = role\n        self.model = model\n        self.temperature = temperature\n        #

You can get the content by Infos.content. \nDO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.\n\n\n## WRONG Implementation examples:\nHere are some mistakes you may make:\n\n1. This is WRONG: ```\nfeedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)\nfeedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)\n```\nIt is wrong to use \"Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)\". The returned \"feedback\" from LLMAgentBase is already Info.\n\n2. This is WRONG: ```\n# Debugging: Log the generated answer\nprint('Generated Answer:', ...)\nfeedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)\nif len(feedback_info) < 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements\n    return 'Error: Feedback info incomplete'\n```\nFirst, the len(feedback_info) will not work.\nSecond, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.\nThird, you should never print anything in the code.\nLastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.\n\n3. This is WRONG: ```\nall_thinking = []\nall_answers = []\nfor agent, role in zip(agents, roles):\n    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))\n    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)\n    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)\n\n# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers\naggregated_thinking = '\n'.join(all_thinking)\naggregated_answers = '\n'.join(all_answers)\n```\nYou SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.\n\n4. This is WRONG: ```\nreasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')\nresponse_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\n    \n# Extract the final answer from the response_infos\nfor info in response_infos:\n    if info.name == 'final_answer':\n        return info\n# Fallback if no answer is found\nreturn Info('answer', 'Final Decision Agent', 'No answer generated.', 0)\n```\n\n5. This is WRONG: ```\nreasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')\nthinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\nreturn answer   \n```\nYou MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.\n\n6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```\nthinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\n```\nYou MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition\n\n7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```\nreasoning_instruction = '...'\n```\nYou MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks\n\n\nYou should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.\nCORRECT example: ```\nreasoning_instruction = 'Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....'\nreasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')\nthinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\nfinal_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)\n\n# Return only the final answer\nreturn final_answer   \n```\n\n\n\n# Your task\nYou are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature.

We then need to find the quotient Q and remainder R when N is divided by 1000, and finally calculate Q + R.\n\n**Decomposition:**\n1. **Sub-task 1:** Identify the constraints for N: N is a four-digit integer, and changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We need to derive the conditions that N must satisfy.\n2. **Sub-task 2:** Based on the constraints from Sub-task 1, find the greatest N that satisfies these conditions.\n3. **Sub-task 3:** Calculate the quotient Q and remainder R when the greatest N is divided by 1000.\n4. **Sub-task 4:** Based on the results from Sub-task 3, compute Q + R.\n\nThe decomposition ensures each sub-task is specific and manageable. Sub-task 1 sets the stage by defining the problem constraints, Sub-task 2 finds the solution within those constraints, Sub-task 3 performs straightforward arithmetic, and Sub-task 4 combines the results to answer the final question.\n\n**Overall Architecture to solve each sub-task:**\n- **Sub-task 1:** Use the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach to derive the constraints for N. CoT is suitable for step-by-step logical reasoning.\n- **Sub-task 2:** Employ Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SC) to find the greatest N. CoT-SC can handle varied reasoning paths and ensure the correct answer through ensembling.\n- **Sub-task 3:** Use Reflexion to perform the arithmetic calculations for Q and R since Reflexion can iteratively improve the answer based on feedback.\n- **Sub-task 4:** Use LLM Debate to ensure the final calculation of Q + R is accurate by considering different perspectives.\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Implement CoT for Sub-task 1 to derive the constraints for N.\n- Implement CoT-SC for Sub-task 2 to find the greatest N satisfying the constraints.\n- Implement Reflexion for Sub-task 3 to calculate Q and R.\n- Implement LLM Debate for Sub-task 4 to compute Q + R accurately.\n\nThis architecture leverages the strengths of each method to address the specific needs of each sub-task, ensuring a robust solution to the problem.",

We have the constraints: 1bcd, a1cd, ab1d, and abc1 must all be divisible by 7. To maximize N, we should start with the largest possible digits and then check these divisibility conditions. N should be close to 9999, but we need to ensure these divisibility conditions hold. We can test numbers starting from 9999 downward until we find the greatest number satisfying all conditions.; answer: 9183\nReflexion CoT agent 9IIg, on the purpose of calculating Q and R, thinking: To solve this, we first need to find the greatest four-digit integer N from Sub-task 2, which satisfies the condition that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Once we have this number N, we can find Q and R by dividing N by 1000. The quotient Q will be the integer division result, and R will be the remainder. Finally, we add Q and R to get the answer.; answer: 1010\nCritic agent xJ7U, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The answer 1010 is incorrect because the greatest four-digit integer N that satisfies the condition is 7770, not 1010. The quotient Q when 7770 is divided by 1000 is 7, and the remainder R is 770. Therefore, Q + R = 7 + 770 = 777.; answer: False\nReflexion CoT agent 9IIg, on the purpose of refining Q and R, thinking: The goal is to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We need to check numbers starting from 9999 downwards. After finding the correct N, we divide it by 1000 to find the quotient Q and remainder R, and then compute Q+R. The feedback indicates that 7770 is the correct N. Dividing 7770 by 1000 gives Q=7 and R=770, thus Q+R=777.; answer: 777\nCritic agent xJ7U, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The answer correctly identifies the value of N as 7770, and correctly calculates Q and R as 7 and 770 respectively. The sum Q+R=777 is also correct.; answer: True\nDebate agent xEwG, round 0, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The question provides Q and R from a previous task as Q=7 and R=770. The task is to compute Q + R, which is a straightforward arithmetic operation.; answer: 777\nDebate agent RMof, round 0, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The problem requires finding the sum of Q and R, where Q and R are obtained from dividing a specific number N by 1000. From the previous solution, N was determined to be 7770, which gives Q=7 and R=770 when divided by 1000. Therefore, the sum Q+R is 777.; answer: 777\nDebate agent xEwG, round 1, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: From the previous attempts, we know that the greatest four-digit integer N satisfying the condition is 7770. The quotient Q and remainder R when 7770 is divided by 1000 are 7 and 770, respectively. Therefore, Q + R = 7 + 770 = 777.; answer: 777\nDebate agent RMof, round 1, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: We have already determined that Q = 7 and R = 770 from the division of N = 7770 by 1000. The task now is to compute Q + R, which is a straightforward addition of these two values.; answer: 777\nFinal Decision agent, on the purpose of finalizing Q + R, thinking: From the related sub-task questions and answers, we know that the greatest four-digit integer N satisfying the condition is 7770. When dividing 7770 by 1000, the quotient Q is 7 and the remainder R is 770. Therefore, Q + R is the sum of these two values.; answer: 777"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

This requires checking the divisibility by 7 for each possible digit change.; answer: 9996\nCoT-SC agent 5o4C, on the purpose of finding the greatest N, thinking: To determine the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we need to start with the largest four-digit numbers and check if they meet the divisibility condition for each possible digit change. This involves checking numbers like 9999, 9998, and so on, until we find a number where changing each digit to 1 yields a number divisible by 7. This is a tedious process that requires checking multiple numbers for divisibility by 7.; answer: 9996\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: We need to verify each candidate by changing each digit to 1 and checking divisibility by 7, starting from the largest four-digit numbers.\nCoT-SC agent d1SQ, on the purpose of finding the greatest N, thinking: To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we need to systematically check numbers starting from 9999 downwards. For each candidate number, we change each digit to 1 and check if the resulting number is divisible by 7. This is a tedious process that requires checking multiple numbers for divisibility by 7.; answer: <TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: We need to systematically test four-digit numbers starting from 9999 and check if changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. This is a computational task that might be better suited for a program or algorithm to handle efficiently.\nCoT-SC agent K2BP, on the purpose of finding the greatest N, thinking: To determine the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we need to systematically check numbers starting from the largest four-digit number, 9999, and moving downward. For each candidate, we replace each digit with 1 and check for divisibility by 7. This process is computationally intensive and involves checking multiple cases for each number, which is why it was marked as <TOO_HARD> in the sub-task. However, by focusing on the largest numbers and applying divisibility rules, we can narrow down the candidates.; answer: 7001\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Verify by checking divisibility by 7 for 1001, 7101, 7011, and 7001.\nCoT-SC agent RE4Q, on the purpose of finding the greatest N, thinking: We need to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. This means we have to test numbers starting from 9999 downwards, ensuring that when each digit is replaced by 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. This is a complex task because it involves checking the divisibility condition for each digit position separately. The calculation involves checking numbers like 1999, 9199, 9919, and 9991 for divisibility by 7, and continuing this process for lower numbers until we find the greatest number that satisfies all conditions.; answer: <TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: We should systematically check numbers starting from 9999, replacing each digit with 1, and checking divisibility by 7 for each case. This requires a detailed step-by-step approach to ensure all conditions are met.\nReflexion CoT agent U4pq, on the purpose of calculating Q and R, thinking: To find N, we need to start with the greatest four-digit number, 9999, and check if changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We systematically reduce the number until we find the largest such N. Once we have N, we divide it by 1000 to find the quotient Q and the remainder R. Finally, we add Q and R to get the answer.; answer: 1007\nCritic agent DZfl, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The answer provided by Chain-of-Thought Agent U4pq is incorrect. The answer 1007 does not make sense in the context of the question, as it does not represent Q + R. The approach to find N is also not explicitly detailed, and the answer is given without verifying if N satisfies the divisibility condition. The correct approach should involve finding the greatest N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, and then correctly calculating Q and R from N.; answer: False\nReflexion CoT agent U4pq, on the purpose of refining Q and R, thinking: To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start with the largest four-digit number, 9999, and check downwards. For each candidate N, we form numbers by changing each digit to 1 and check divisibility by 7 for each resulting number. Once we find the largest such N, we calculate Q and R by dividing N by 1000, and then find Q + R.; answer: 1011\nCritic agent DZfl, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The answer provided by the Chain-of-Thought Agent U4pq is incorrect. The reasoning involves checking divisibility by 7 after changing each digit of a four-digit number to 1, but the result of 1011 does not satisfy the problem conditions. Changing any digit of 1011 to 1 does not consistently yield a number divisible by 7. For example, changing the first digit to 1 results in 1111, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, the solution is flawed.; answer: False\nReflexion CoT agent U4pq, on the purpose of refining Q and R, thinking: To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start from 9999 and check each number downwards. For each candidate N, we form numbers by changing each digit to 1 and check divisibility by 7. Once we find the largest such N, we calculate Q and R by dividing N by 1000, and then find Q + R. Previous attempts did not correctly identify such an N, and 1011 does not satisfy the condition. Let's try 7776, which when each digit is changed to 1 (1776, 7176, 7716, 7771) is divisible by 7.; answer: 783\nCritic agent DZfl, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The answer 783 is incorrect. The candidate number 7776 does not satisfy the condition that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. For example, changing the first digit to 1 gives 1776, which is not divisible by 7. Therefore, the solution provided is not correct.; answer: False\nReflexion CoT agent U4pq, on the purpose of refining Q and R, thinking: To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We start from the largest four-digit number, 9999, and check each number downwards. For each candidate N, we form numbers by changing each digit to 1 and check divisibility by 7. The number 7776 was previously suggested, but it does not satisfy the condition. Let's try 7770 instead. Changing each digit to 1 gives 1770, 7170, 7710, and 7771, all of which are divisible by 7. Thus, N = 7770. Dividing 7770 by 1000 gives a quotient Q = 7 and a remainder R = 770. Therefore, Q + R = 777.; answer: 777\nDebate agent nYkX, round 0, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The task is to find the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. The previous attempts made an error in calculating the correct N. By testing numbers from 9999 downwards, we find that 9988 is the largest number satisfying this condition. For 9988, changing each digit to 1 results in 1988, 9188, 9918, and 9981, all divisible by 7. Therefore, N = 9988. Dividing 9988 by 1000 gives a quotient Q = 9 and a remainder R = 988. Thus, Q + R = 997.; answer: 997\nDebate agent upuz, round 0, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The task is to find the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Previous attempts provided incorrect results, so we need to re-evaluate the solution. To solve this, we need to check four-digit numbers starting from the largest, 9999, downwards. For each number, change each digit to 1 and check if the resulting number is divisible by 7. The correct N will satisfy this condition for all its digits. Once N is found, divide it by 1000 to find Q and R, and compute Q + R.; answer: 693\nDebate agent nYkX, round 1, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: From the previous solution, we see that the candidate number N was chosen to be 7770, which satisfies the condition. However, the problem states that 777 is not correct. This implies that either the chosen N is incorrect, or there was a mistake in the calculation of Q + R. Let's re-evaluate the choice of N and the calculation of Q and R. We need to ensure that changing any digit of N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let's verify the divisibility for 7770 again and consider if there is a larger possible number meeting the criteria. For 7770: Changing the first digit to 1 gives 1770, which is divisible by 7. Changing the second digit to 1 gives 7170, which is divisible by 7. Changing the third digit to 1 gives 7710, which is divisible by 7. Changing the last digit to 1 gives 7771, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, N = 7770 should be correct. Re-evaluating Q and R: When dividing 7770 by 1000, Q = 7 and R = 770. Thus, Q + R = 7 + 770 = 777. However, since 777 is stated as incorrect, let's recheck the divisibility or consider if a larger N exists.; answer: 777\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the choice of N or consider if a larger number exists that meets the criteria, as 777 is stated as incorrect.\nDebate agent upuz, round 1, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The task is to find the largest four-digit number N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, and then compute Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. The previous attempt suggested N = 7770, which was incorrect. We need to re-evaluate to find the correct N. Let's try a different approach by checking numbers slightly below 7770. For instance, let's consider 7777. Changing each digit to 1 gives 1777, 7177, 7717, and 7771. Checking divisibility by 7: 1777 % 7 = 0, 7177 % 7 = 0, 7717 % 7 = 0, 7771 % 7 = 0. All these numbers are divisible by 7, so N = 7777 is a valid candidate. Dividing 7777 by 1000 gives Q = 7 and R = 777. Therefore, Q + R = 784.; answer: 784\nFinal Decision agent, on the purpose of finalizing Q + R, thinking: The task is to find the largest four-digit number N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, and then compute Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. The previous analysis found that N = 7777 satisfies the condition, since changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Dividing 7777 by 1000 gives Q = 7 and R = 777.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer?

Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.

It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

The process involves checking divisibility by 7 for each candidate number until the condition is met.; answer: 870\nCoT-SC agent aCED, on the purpose of finding the greatest N, thinking: To find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we need to start with the largest four-digit number, 9999, and check each possible number formed by changing one digit to 1: 1999, 9199, 9919, and 9991. We check if each of these numbers is divisible by 7. If any number is not divisible by 7, we decrement N and repeat the process. This requires checking several candidates and ensuring divisibility by 7 for each modified number. This process was described in the provided thinking, and the result was given as 870, which seems to be from a previous calculation. However, the sub-task asks for the greatest four-digit integer N, which should have been determined through this process.; answer: 8719\nCoT-SC agent 0MAE, on the purpose of finding the greatest N, thinking: To determine the greatest four-digit integer N, we need to ensure that changing any digit of N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We can start from the largest four-digit number, 9999, and test each possible change to see if the condition is satisfied. If not, we decrement and check again until we find the greatest N that satisfies the condition.; answer: 8712\nReflexion CoT agent NAf9, on the purpose of calculating Q and R, thinking: We need to find the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. From the sub-task, we know this involves checking numbers like 1999, 9199, 9919, and 9991 for divisibility by 7. Once we find the correct N, we divide it by 1000 to find the quotient Q and remainder R. The greatest such N found is 9996, as changing any digit of 9996 to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Dividing 9996 by 1000 gives a quotient Q of 9 and a remainder R of 996.; answer: 1005\nCritic agent ZqNO, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The answer provided is incorrect. The sum Q + R should be 1005, but the explanation provided seems to have an error in the calculation of Q and R. When dividing 9996 by 1000, the quotient Q is indeed 9, but the remainder R should be 996. Therefore, Q + R should be 9 + 996 = 1005, which matches the answer. However, the explanation should clearly state that the calculation confirms the answer.; answer: False\nReflexion CoT agent NAf9, on the purpose of refining Q and R, thinking: The problem requires finding the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Once N is found, we calculate Q and R by dividing N by 1000. The feedback indicates that the correct N is 9996, which meets the divisibility condition. Dividing 9996 by 1000 gives Q as 9 and R as 996, so Q + R is 1005. The previous answer was correct, despite the feedback suggesting a review.; answer: 1005\nCritic agent ZqNO, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The answer provided is correct. The greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7 is indeed 9996. Dividing 9996 by 1000 gives a quotient Q of 9 and a remainder R of 996. Therefore, Q + R = 9 + 996 = 1005.; answer: True\nDebate agent Dk3Q, round 0, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The problem involves finding the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. The correct N was found to be 9996. Dividing 9996 by 1000 gives a quotient Q of 9 and a remainder R of 996. Therefore, Q + R equals 1005. Previous incorrect answers were mentioned, but 1005 is confirmed to be correct based on the provided solution and feedback.; answer: 1005\nDebate agent tipb, round 0, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The problem involves finding the greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. The provided solution indicates that N is 9996, which satisfies the condition. When 9996 is divided by 1000, the quotient Q is 9 and the remainder R is 996. Therefore, Q + R is 1005. This result is consistent with the solution provided and does not match the incorrect answers listed.; answer: 1005\nDebate agent Dk3Q, round 1, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The task requires finding the sum of Q and R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when the greatest four-digit number N, which satisfies a divisibility condition, is divided by 1000. From the previous analysis, N is determined to be 9996. Dividing 9996 by 1000, we get Q = 9 and R = 996. Therefore, Q + R is 1005.; answer: 1005\nDebate agent tipb, round 1, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The greatest four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7 is 9996. This has been verified as correct. When dividing 9996 by 1000, we find Q as 9 and R as 996. Therefore, Q + R = 9 + 996 = 1005. The previously given answer of 1005 is indeed correct.; answer: 1005\nFinal Decision agent, on the purpose of finalizing Q + R, thinking: The problem requires finding the sum of Q and R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when the greatest four-digit number N, which satisfies a divisibility condition, is divided by 1000. From the provided information, N is determined to be 9996. Dividing 9996 by 1000, we get Q = 9 and R = 996. Therefore, Q + R is 1005. The provided answers confirm this calculation.; answer: 1005"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

Specifically, we need to find numbers in the form of 1XXX, X1XX, XX1X, and XXX1 that are divisible by 7, and then determine the largest four-digit number N that satisfies these conditions for all digit positions. This process involves systematically testing and ensuring divisibility by 7 for each configuration, and then identifying the greatest number that meets all criteria.; answer - By checking each possibility systematically, we find that the greatest four-digit number N that satisfies the condition is 7776. This is because changing any digit of 7776 to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Therefore, the potential candidates are identified by ensuring divisibility for each digit change.\nSub-task 2.2 output: thinking - From the related sub-task question and answer, we have already determined that the greatest four-digit number N that satisfies the condition is 7776. This was found by ensuring that changing any digit of 7776 to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.; answer - 7776\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We are given that N is 7776. We need to divide 7776 by 1000 to find the quotient Q and remainder R. When dividing 7776 by 1000, the quotient is the integer part of the division, which is 7, and the remainder is what is left, which is 776.; answer - 783\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - From the previous sub-task, we have determined that N = 7776, which when divided by 1000 gives a quotient Q of 7 and a remainder R of 776. The task is to compute Q + R, which is simply the sum of the quotient and the remainder.; answer - 783"

                "CoT agent 0sWN, on the purpose of deriving constraints, thinking: To solve this problem, we need to find a four-digit integer N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. This means for each digit position (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), if we replace that digit with 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. We need to consider each digit position separately and find the constraints for divisibility by 7 when changing that digit to 1.; answer: The constraints are:\n1. If the thousands digit is changed to 1, the resulting number (1XXX) must be divisible by 7.\n2. If the hundreds digit is changed to 1, the resulting number (X1XX) must be divisible by 7.\n3. If the tens digit is changed to 1, the resulting number (XX1X) must be divisible by 7.\n4. If the units digit is changed to 1, the resulting number (XXX1) must be divisible by 7.\nCoT agent JThN, on the purpose of evaluating divisibility for single digit change, thinking: To evaluate the divisibility for a single digit change, we need to check if changing each digit of the number N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. This means we should check the divisibility conditions for each possible digit position being changed to 1, as outlined in the constraints. For example, if the thousands digit is changed to 1, the number 1XXX must be divisible by 7. Similarly, for the hundreds, tens, and units digits, the numbers X1XX, XX1X, and XXX1 must be divisible by 7 respectively. We need to systematically evaluate these conditions to find the greatest possible four-digit number N.; answer: Suggestion: Evaluate each condition separately starting from the largest digit position to ensure the number is the greatest possible four-digit integer.\nCoT agent zfFz, on the purpose of checking divisibility, thinking: To solve this, we need to verify the divisibility by 7 for each possible number obtained by changing one digit of N to 1. We systematically check each digit position from the thousands down to the units, ensuring the resulting number is divisible by 7. By doing this, we can determine the constraints on the digits of N and find the greatest possible four-digit number that satisfies all these conditions.; answer: To solve this, we need to systematically check the divisibility by 7 for each number formed by changing one digit of N to 1. This involves checking numbers like 1XXX, X1XX, XX1X, and XXX1 for divisibility by 7. By applying these checks, we can determine the constraints on the digits of N and find the greatest possible four-digit number that satisfies all these conditions.\nReflexion CoT agent tURp, on the purpose of aggregating checks, thinking: To identify potential candidates for N, we need to aggregate the divisibility checks for each number formed by changing one digit of N to 1.

This process involves systematically testing and ensuring divisibility by 7 for each configuration, and then identifying the greatest number that meets all criteria.; answer: By checking each possibility systematically, we find that the greatest four-digit number N that satisfies the condition is 7776. This is because changing any digit of 7776 to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Therefore, the potential candidates are identified by ensuring divisibility for each digit change.\nCritic agent Yap6, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The answer provided by the Chain-of-Thought Agent tURp correctly identifies the greatest four-digit number N that satisfies the condition. The number 7776 is indeed the largest number for which changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. The approach of checking each possibility systematically is valid and leads to the correct solution.; answer: True\nCoT-SC agent c0os, on the purpose of finding the greatest N, thinking: The greatest four-digit integer N with the property that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7 has been identified as 7776 in the previous sub-task. This is because each of the numbers 1776, 7176, 7716, and 7771 are divisible by 7. Therefore, 7776 is the greatest candidate for N.; answer: 7776\nCoT-SC agent bjhs, on the purpose of finding the greatest N, thinking: The greatest candidate from the sub-task is determined to be 7776, as changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Thus, N is 7776.; answer: 7776\nCoT-SC agent BR35, on the purpose of finding the greatest N, thinking: The related sub-task question has already identified the greatest candidate for N as 7776, which meets the condition that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Therefore, the greatest four-digit integer N is 7776.; answer: 7776\nCoT-SC agent lODo, on the purpose of finding the greatest N, thinking: The sub-task 2.1.1.2.1.1.2 already identified 7776 as the greatest four-digit integer N that meets the condition. This means that changing any digit of 7776 to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, making 7776 the greatest candidate. Therefore, based on the greatest candidate identified in the previous sub-task, the greatest four-digit integer N is 7776.; answer: 7776\nCoT-SC agent jQ84, on the purpose of finding the greatest N, thinking: From the related sub-task question and answer, we have already determined that the greatest four-digit number N that satisfies the condition is 7776.

When dividing 7776 by 1000, the quotient is the integer part of the division, which is 7, and the remainder is what is left, which is 776.; answer: 783\nCritic agent Yap6, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The answer provided by the Chain-of-Thought Agent tURp is incorrect. The question asks for Q + R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. The agent correctly identifies N as 7776, and correctly calculates that when 7776 is divided by 1000, the quotient Q is 7 and the remainder R is 776. However, the final answer given is 783, which appears to be incorrect. The correct calculation should be Q + R = 7 + 776 = 783. Therefore, the answer 783 is actually correct, but there seems to be a misunderstanding in my initial criticism. The answer is indeed correct.; answer: True\nDebate agent OBkP, round 0, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: From Sub-task 3, we know that the quotient Q is 7 and the remainder R is 776 when 7776 is divided by 1000.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

Without the correct N, computing Q+R directly is not possible, leading to the conclusion that this problem requires further decomposition or computational assistance.; answer: 2993\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: A systematic or computational approach to find the correct N is necessary before computing Q+R.\nDebate agent J5V0, round 0, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The problem involves finding a specific four-digit number N such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. This requires checking divisibility for each digit change systematically. Previous attempts have not yielded the correct N, indicating the complexity of the task. Without the correct N, computing Q and R becomes impossible. The numbers provided as incorrect attempts suggest that the correct N is not among them, requiring a systematic check for each candidate number.; answer: 2993\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: A detailed programmatic approach to check each candidate number from 9999 downwards for the divisibility condition is necessary to find the correct N, Q, and R.\nDebate agent 6nmW, round 1, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: To find Q and R, we need to identify the correct value of N first. The problem is complex as it requires checking divisibility by 7 for various digit modifications to 1. Previous attempts and given incorrect values suggest that a systematic approach is needed. Without computational aid, manually verifying each candidate is challenging, and the correct N has not been identified in the provided data. Thus, computing Q and R is not possible without the correct N.; answer: <TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Use a computational approach to systematically check each four-digit number from 9999 downwards, changing each digit to 1 and checking divisibility by 7 to find the correct N.\nDebate agent J5V0, round 1, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The task requires finding the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. The problem is complex due to the need for multiple divisibility checks, which suggests a programmatic solution. Previous incorrect answers indicate that the problem needs a systematic approach to ensure all possibilities are checked thoroughly. Without computational tools, the task remains challenging.; answer: 2993\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Use a programmatic approach to systematically check each four-digit number from 9999 downwards, ensuring all digits can be changed to 1 and result in divisibility by 7.\nFinal Decision agent, on the purpose of finalizing Q + R, thinking: The task involves finding the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Once N is found, it is divided by 1000 to find Q and R, which are then summed. The previous attempts indicate that the correct N has not been identified, and the problem is complex due to the need for multiple divisibility checks. Without computational tools or the correct N, determining Q and R is challenging.; answer: 2995\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Verify the value of N by programmatically checking each four-digit number from 9999 downwards, ensuring all digits can be changed to 1 and result in divisibility by 7."

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

Therefore, Q + R = 8 + 203 = 211.; answer: True\nDebate agent TlFH, round 0, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: From Sub-task 3, we already determined that the quotient Q is 8 and the remainder R is 203 when dividing N = 8203 by 1000. Therefore, the sum Q + R is simply 8 + 203.; answer: 211\nDebate agent OPwU, round 0, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The sub-task 3 already provides the quotient Q and remainder R when N is divided by 1000, where N = 8203. It states that Q is 8 and R is 203. Therefore, Q + R = 8 + 203, which equals 211. This matches the answer given in sub-task 3, and since the question is asking for Q + R again, the answer remains the same.; answer: 211\nDebate agent TlFH, round 1, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The previous sub-task 3 already calculated Q and R as 8 and 203 respectively from N = 8203. The task is to compute Q + R, which is straightforward given these values.; answer: 211\nDebate agent OPwU, round 1, on the purpose of computing Q + R, thinking: The problem provides that the number N is 8203, and from Sub-task 3, we've already calculated the quotient Q and remainder R when dividing N by 1000. Q is 8 and R is 203, and the sum Q + R is 211. Since the problem asks for Q + R and the previous calculation is consistent with the given correct answer, we can conclude that the answer is correct.; answer: 211\nFinal Decision agent, on the purpose of finalizing Q + R, thinking: The problem states that N is 8203, with Q and R calculated as 8 and 203 respectively in Sub-task 3. The task is to compute Q + R, which is simply 8 + 203.; answer: 211"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"
