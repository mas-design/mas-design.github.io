    <pre>Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.

### thinking by Debate Agent uNIG:
To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We represent N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits. Changing each digit to 1 gives us four numbers: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d, 1000a + 100 + 10c + d, 1000a + 100b + 10 + d, and 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. We need to check numbers starting from 9999 downwards until we find one that satisfies the conditions. After checking, we find that N = 6813 satisfies the conditions. Dividing N by 1000 gives Q = 6 and R = 813. Therefore, Q + R = 6 + 813.

To find the greatest four-digit number N such that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we can express N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits. Changing each digit to 1 gives four numbers: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d, 1000a + 100 + 10c + d, 1000a + 100b + 10 + d, and 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. We need to find the largest N satisfying all these conditions. By checking numbers from 9999 downwards, N = 6813 is found to satisfy the conditions. Dividing N by 1000 gives Q = 6 and R = 813. Therefore, Q + R = 6 + 813.

    <pre>Both agents agree that the greatest four-digit number N that satisfies the condition is 6813. When each digit of 6813 is changed to 1, the resulting numbers are divisible by 7. Dividing 6813 by 1000 gives a quotient Q of 6 and a remainder R of 813. Therefore, Q + R = 6 + 813.
