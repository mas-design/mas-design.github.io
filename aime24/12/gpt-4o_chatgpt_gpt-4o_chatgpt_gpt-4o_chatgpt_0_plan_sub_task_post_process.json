Now, we need to express this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Use Euler's formula: e^{i\u03b8} = cos(\u03b8) + i sin(\u03b8) and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos(\u03b8) - i sin(\u03b8). Substitute these into the expression and simplify to find the real part as a function of \u03b8.\nThe real part of the expression is 300cos(\u03b8) + 36cos(\u03b8) - 468sin(\u03b8) + 24sin(\u03b8), which simplifies to 336cos(\u03b8) - 444sin(\u03b8).\nWe have the expression for the real part as 336cos(\u03b8) - 444sin(\u03b8). To find the maximum value, we can express it in the form Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude and \u03c6 is a phase shift. The amplitude R is given by R = \u221a(336^2 + 444^2), and tan(\u03c6) = -444/336. However, the sub-task 3a asks for \u03c6 using tan(\u03c6) = -432/324, which seems to be a typo or mistake, as it doesn't match the coefficients in the expression we found. Therefore, I will calculate \u03c6 using the correct coefficients: tan(\u03c6) = -444/336.\nTo maximize the real part of the expression 336cos(\u03b8) - 444sin(\u03b8), we should express it as Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude and \u03c6 is the phase shift. The amplitude R is calculated as R = \u221a(336^2 + 444^2). The phase shift \u03c6 is calculated using tan(\u03c6) = -444/336, which gives \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28).

This is the condition to maximize the real part of the expression.\nFrom sub-task 3b1a, we determined that to maximize the real part of the expression, we need to set \u03b8 = -\u03c6, where \u03c6 is the phase shift given by \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28). The adjustment needed for \u03b8 is to change it to -\u03c6. Therefore, the adjustment needed for \u03b8 is simply to set \u03b8 to -\u03c6, which is the negative of the calculated phase shift \u03c6.\nWe have \u03b8 = -arctan(-37/28). The expression -arctan(-37/28) is equivalent to arctan(37/28), since -arctan(-x) = arctan(x). The angle arctan(37/28) is in the first quadrant because both 37 and 28 are positive, meaning the angle is between 0 and \u03c0/2.\nWe have determined that \u03b8 = -arctan(-37/28) is equivalent to arctan(37/28), which places it in the first quadrant. However, for complex numbers of the form (a+bi)z + (c+di)/z where |z| is constant, we often use the form z = re^(i\u03b8) and consider the periodicity of the complex exponential function. Since we are dealing with |z| = 4, we have z = 4e^(i\u03b8). The periodicity of the exponential function means that \u03b8 can be adjusted by adding multiples of 2\u03c0 to remain in the same orientation. We need to finalize \u03b8 based on the quadrant information and periodicity, and ensure it is consistent with the conditions given. Since \u03b8 is in the first quadrant, and arctan(37/28) is already in the first quadrant, we do not need to adjust it by adding \u03c0 or 2\u03c0. Therefore, \u03b8 = arctan(37/28) is the finalized angle.",

This involves finding the angle \u03c6 whose tangent is -444/336. Simplifying -444/336 gives -37/28. We can calculate \u03c6 using the arctangent function: \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28).

From sub-task 3a, we have \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28). If z = re^{i\u03b8}, then the expression becomes a function of \u03b8, and we need to find the value of \u03b8 that maximizes the real part. The real part will depend on the cosine of the difference between \u03c6 and \u03b8. The maximum real part is achieved when cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = 1, which implies \u03b8 = \u03c6 + 2k\u03c0 for some integer k.; answer - The real part is maximized when \u03b8 = \u03c6 + 2k\u03c0, where \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28).\nSub-task 3b1b output: thinking - To maximize the real part of the expression, we need \u03b8 to be aligned such that cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = 1.

Therefore, \u03b8 should be adjusted to \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28), ensuring that \u03b8 = \u03c6 + 2k\u03c0.; answer - Set \u03b8 to \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28) to maximize the real part.\nSub-task 3b2a output: thinking - The angle \u03b8 is set to \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28) based on the maximization condition.

However, the exact expression for the real part in terms of \u03b8 is not provided, making it difficult to directly compute the derivative.; answer - <TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Provide the expression for the real part of the given function in terms of \u03b8 to compute the derivative.\nSub-task 3b2b2 output: thinking - To solve for critical points of \u03b8, we need the expression for the real part of the given function in terms of \u03b8. The expression involves z = 4(cos \u03b8 + i sin \u03b8) and its reciprocal, which is 1/z = (1/4)(cos \u03b8 - i sin \u03b8). The real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z can be found by substituting z and 1/z and simplifying.
