    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```

You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.

    <pre>thought: To solve the complex question of finding the largest possible real part of the given expression, we can decompose the problem into simpler sub-tasks that can be effectively handled by the existing architectures. The expression involves a complex number with a modulus constraint, which suggests a geometric interpretation. The task can be broken down as follows:

**Decomposition:**
1. **Sub-task 1:** Determine the parametric representation of the complex number $z$ given $|z|=4$. This involves expressing $z$ in terms of a parameter $\theta$ such that $z = 4e^{i\theta}$.
2. **Sub-task 2:** Substitute the parametric form of $z$ into the original expression and simplify it to express the real part as a function of $\theta$.
3. **Sub-task 3:** Analyze the function obtained in Sub-task 2 to find the value of $\theta$ that maximizes the real part.

This decomposition ensures each sub-task is manageable and can be addressed using a specific architecture. The first sub-task is straightforward and involves basic complex number manipulation. The second sub-task requires algebraic manipulation and simplification, which can be handled by a reasoning agent. The third sub-task involves optimization, which can be tackled using a debate-based approach to explore different reasoning paths and converge on the optimal solution.

**Overall Architecture:**
- **Sub-task 1:** Use the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) block to derive the parametric form of $z$.
- **Sub-task 2:** Use the Self-Refine (Reflexion) block to substitute and simplify the expression, as it can iteratively refine the algebraic manipulation.
- **Sub-task 3:** Use the LLM Debate block to explore and debate different reasoning paths for maximizing the real part, ensuring convergence to the optimal solution.

**Implementation:**
1. Implement CoT for Sub-task 1 to derive $z = 4e^{i\theta}$.
2. Implement Reflexion for Sub-task 2 to substitute and simplify the expression.
3. Implement LLM Debate for Sub-task 3 to find the optimal $\theta$.

This architecture leverages the strengths of each block in handling specific aspects of the problem, ensuring a robust solution.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
- The sub-tasks are not solvable in their current form. Sub-task 3 explicitly contains &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that the task is too complex for the LLM Debate block to handle alone. The suggestion given was to provide further details on calculating θ from the expression θ + φ = 0. This implies that the task requires further decomposition to make it manageable.

- Sub-task 2 seems to be solvable as it correctly substitutes and simplifies the expression. However, the Reflexion block might not be the most efficient way to handle it because it involves iterative refinement, which is not necessary for a straightforward simplification.

- Sub-task 1 is correctly handled by the CoT block, as the parametric representation of the complex number is straightforward.

(2) **Completeness:**
- The sub-tasks do include necessary information from the original query, but the connection between sub-tasks needs improvement. Sub-task 3 relies heavily on the output of sub-task 2, and further decomposition is needed to ensure all critical information is addressed.

(3) **Fitness:**
- The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The final response is not updated and still gives the same mistaken answer. This suggests the need for further decomposition and improved sub-task instructions to avoid known incorrect answers.

**Improvements:**
- **Further Decomposition:** Sub-task 3 should be further decomposed to focus on calculating φ and then finding θ. This will make the task more manageable and increase the likelihood of obtaining the correct solution.

- **Improved Subtask Architecture:** Use the CoT block for sub-task 2 instead of Reflexion, as it is more suited for straightforward algebraic manipulation.

- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Add a note to sub-task 3 that known incorrect answers should be avoided, as indicated in the memory.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last Sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3a: Calculate φ using tan(φ) = -432/324, New Sub-task 3b: Determine θ using θ = -φ.
    - Justification: By breaking down the task of maximizing the real part into calculating φ and then θ, each sub-task becomes more focused and easier to solve. The calculation of φ is a straightforward trigonometric task, and determining θ from φ is a simple application of the relationship θ = -φ.

    **Improved Subtask Architecture:**
    - Last Sub-task Architecture (Reflexion for Sub-task 2) -&gt; (improve to) New Sub-task Architecture (CoT for Sub-task 2).
    - Justification: The CoT block is more suitable for direct algebraic manipulation without the need for iterative refinement. This change will streamline the process and focus on obtaining the correct simplification.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - Add to the instruction of the last sub-task: &#34;It is known that the previous final answers, such as &#39;The value of θ that maximizes the real part is θ = -arctan(-432/324).&#39; are not correct.&#34;

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
- Sub-task 3b contains &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that it is too complex for the current architecture. The suggestion was to check the quadrant of θ, which implies the need for further decomposition to address this aspect.
- Sub-task 3a and 3b are not solved correctly, as indicated by the incorrect final response. This suggests that the decomposition or the handling of these tasks is flawed.
- Sub-task 2 is correctly handled by the CoT block as it provides the correct simplification of the expression.

(2) **Completeness:**
- The sub-tasks include the necessary information from the original query, but the connection between sub-tasks needs further refinement. Specifically, sub-task 3b should address the quadrant issue to ensure the correct determination of θ.

(3) **Fitness:**
- The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The final response has not been updated and still gives the same mistaken answer. This suggests the need for further decomposition and improved sub-task instructions to avoid known incorrect answers.

**Improvements:**
- **Further Decomposition:** Sub-task 3b should be further decomposed to explicitly address the quadrant issue and periodicity of the tangent function. This will make the task more manageable and increase the likelihood of obtaining the correct solution.

- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Add a note to sub-task 3b that known incorrect answers should be avoided, as indicated in the memory.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last Sub-task 3b -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3b1: Determine the correct quadrant for θ, New Sub-task 3b2: Adjust θ based on quadrant and periodicity.
    - Justification: By breaking down the task of determining θ into checking the quadrant and adjusting for periodicity, each sub-task becomes more focused and easier to solve. This ensures that θ is correctly calculated, taking into account the full range of possible angles.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - Add to the instruction of the last sub-task: &#34;It is known that previous final answers, such as &#39;θ = -arctan(-432/324) + π&#39; are not correct.&#34;

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To find the parametric representation of a complex number z with |z| = 4, we can express z in polar form. A complex number z with magnitude 4 can be written as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z.; answer - z = 4e^{iθ}\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have z = 4e^{iθ}, so we can substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + \\frac{96+144i}{z}.

To find φ, we can take the arctan of this value. The tangent function is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. We calculate arctan(-432/324) and find the angle φ in the appropriate quadrant.; answer - -53\nSub-task 3b1 output: thinking - The angle φ was calculated as -53 degrees, which places it in the fourth quadrant. However, the problem involves maximizing the real part of the expression, and the angle θ that maximizes the real part should be considered. Since the real part is maximized when the angle is aligned with the positive real axis, we need to consider the angle that would achieve this maximum. The angle θ should likely be in the first quadrant where the real part of a complex number is maximized. Without additional context or calculations from previous sub-tasks, it&#39;s challenging to determine the exact quadrant for θ just based on φ.; answer - First quadrant\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Review the relationship between φ and θ in the context of maximizing the real part of the given expression, possibly involving additional calculations or context from previous sub-tasks.\nSub-task 3b2 output: thinking - The problem involves maximizing the real part of a complex expression with a constraint on the modulus of z. The angle θ should be chosen to align the expression with the maximum real part. Given that θ was incorrectly calculated as -arctan(-432/324) + π, and considering the periodic nature of trigonometric functions, θ should be adjusted to correctly align with the positive real axis. The periodicity of the tangent function and the requirement for the real part to be maximized suggest that the angle should be adjusted to the first quadrant, as indicated in sub-task 3b1.

A complex number z with magnitude 4 can be written as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z.; answer: z = 4e^{iθ}\nCoT agent 7rdF, on substituting and simplifying, thinking: We have z = 4e^{iθ}, so we can substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + \\frac{96+144i}{z}. Substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, we get (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + \\frac{96+144i}{4e^{iθ}}. Simplifying, this becomes (300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ}) + (24e^{-iθ} + 36ie^{-iθ}). We can use Euler&#39;s formula to express e^{iθ} = \\cosθ + i\\sinθ and e^{-iθ} = \\cosθ - i\\sinθ. The real part of the expression is then 300\\cosθ + 24\\cosθ = 324\\cosθ. Therefore, the real part as a function of θ is 324\\cosθ.; answer: 324\\cosθ\nCoT agent oVp0, on calculating φ, thinking: We have the tangent of an angle φ given by tan(φ) = -432/324. To find φ, we can take the arctan of this value. The tangent function is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. We calculate arctan(-432/324) and find the angle φ in the appropriate quadrant.; answer: -53\nCoT agent 1xXr, on determining the correct quadrant for θ, thinking: The angle φ was calculated as -53 degrees, which places it in the fourth quadrant. However, the problem involves maximizing the real part of the expression, and the angle θ that maximizes the real part should be considered. Since the real part is maximized when the angle is aligned with the positive real axis, we need to consider the angle that would achieve this maximum. The angle θ should likely be in the first quadrant where the real part of a complex number is maximized. Without additional context or calculations from previous sub-tasks, it&#39;s challenging to determine the exact quadrant for θ just based on φ.; answer: First quadrant\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Review the relationship between φ and θ in the context of maximizing the real part of the given expression, possibly involving additional calculations or context from previous sub-tasks.\nCoT agent WAqt, on adjusting θ based on quadrant and periodicity, thinking: The problem involves maximizing the real part of a complex expression with a constraint on the modulus of z. The angle θ should be chosen to align the expression with the maximum real part. Given that θ was incorrectly calculated as -arctan(-432/324) + π, and considering the periodic nature of trigonometric functions, θ should be adjusted to correctly align with the positive real axis. The periodicity of the tangent function and the requirement for the real part to be maximized suggest that the angle should be adjusted to the first quadrant, as indicated in sub-task 3b1. However, without specific calculations or context from previous sub-tasks, determining the exact adjustment for θ is challenging.; answer: First quadrant\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the angle θ to ensure it aligns with maximizing the real part, possibly involving recalculating based on the expression&#39;s alignment with the positive real axis.&#34;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
- Sub-task 3b1 and 3b2 both contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that they are too complex for the current architecture. The suggestions indicate that the relationship between φ and θ needs further exploration, particularly in terms of maximizing the real part of the expression. This suggests the need for further decomposition or a more informed approach to these tasks.
- Sub-task 3a correctly calculates φ but does not provide adequate context for its application in subsequent steps. Sub-task 3b1 and 3b2 fail due to a lack of clarity on how to adjust θ for maximizing the real part.
- Sub-task 2 is correctly handled by the CoT block, providing the correct simplification of the expression.

(2) **Completeness:**
- The sub-tasks include necessary information from the original query, but the connection between sub-tasks needs further refinement. Specifically, sub-task 3b should address the quadrant issue and how to adjust θ based on the real part maximization.

(3) **Fitness:**
- The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The final response has not been updated and still gives the same mistaken answer. This suggests the need for further decomposition and improved sub-task instructions to avoid known incorrect answers.

**Improvements:**
- **Further Decomposition:** Sub-task 3b1 and 3b2 should be further decomposed to explicitly address the relationship between φ and θ, focusing on how to adjust θ to maximize the real part.

- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Add a note to sub-task 3b2 that known incorrect answers should be avoided, as indicated in the memory.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last Sub-task 3b1 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3b1a: Explore the relationship between φ and θ, New Sub-task 3b1b: Calculate the adjustment needed for θ based on this relationship.
    - Last Sub-task 3b2 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3b2a: Determine the quadrant for θ, New Sub-task 3b2b: Finalize θ based on quadrant and periodicity.
    - Justification: By breaking down the tasks further, each sub-task becomes more focused and easier to solve. This ensures that θ is correctly calculated, taking into account the full range of possible angles and the relationship between φ and θ.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - Add to the instruction of the last sub-task: &#34;It is known that previous final answers, such as &#39;θ = -arctan(-432/324) + π&#39; and &#39;First quadrant&#39; are not correct.&#34;

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem asks for the parametric representation of a complex number z given that |z| = 4. A complex number z with a given magnitude can be represented in polar form. Since |z| = 4, we can write z as 4 times a unit complex number on the unit circle. The unit complex number can be represented as e^{iθ}, where θ is the angle in radians. Therefore, we can express z as z = 4e^{iθ}. This is a standard way to represent complex numbers with a given magnitude.; answer - z = 4e^{iθ}\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have z = 4e^{iθ}, so substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. We get (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ}). Simplifying, this becomes (300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ}) + (24e^{-iθ} + 36ie^{-iθ}). Now, we need to express this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Use Euler&#39;s formula: e^{iθ} = cos(θ) + i sin(θ) and e^{-iθ} = cos(θ) - i sin(θ). Substitute these into the expression and simplify to find the real part as a function of θ.; answer - The real part of the expression is 300cos(θ) + 36cos(θ) - 468sin(θ) + 24sin(θ), which simplifies to 336cos(θ) - 444sin(θ).\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - We have the expression for the real part as 336cos(θ) - 444sin(θ). To find the maximum value, we can express it in the form Rcos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is a phase shift. The amplitude R is given by R = √(336^2 + 444^2), and tan(φ) = -444/336. However, the sub-task 3a asks for φ using tan(φ) = -432/324, which seems to be a typo or mistake, as it doesn&#39;t match the coefficients in the expression we found. Therefore, I will calculate φ using the correct coefficients: tan(φ) = -444/336.; answer - tan(φ) = -444/336 = -37/28\nφ = arctan(-37/28)\nSub-task 3b1a output: thinking - To maximize the real part of the expression 336cos(θ) - 444sin(θ), we should express it as Rcos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The amplitude R is calculated as R = √(336^2 + 444^2). The phase shift φ is calculated using tan(φ) = -444/336, which gives φ = arctan(-37/28). To maximize the expression Rcos(θ + φ), we need to set θ + φ = 0, which means θ = -φ. This is the condition to maximize the real part of the expression.; answer - The relationship between φ and θ to maximize the real part is θ = -φ.\nSub-task 3b1b output: thinking - From sub-task 3b1a, we determined that to maximize the real part of the expression, we need to set θ = -φ, where φ is the phase shift given by φ = arctan(-37/28). The adjustment needed for θ is to change it to -φ. Therefore, the adjustment needed for θ is simply to set θ to -φ, which is the negative of the calculated phase shift φ.; answer - Set θ to -arctan(-37/28) to maximize the real part.\nSub-task 3b2a output: thinking - We have θ = -arctan(-37/28). The expression -arctan(-37/28) is equivalent to arctan(37/28), since -arctan(-x) = arctan(x). The angle arctan(37/28) is in the first quadrant because both 37 and 28 are positive, meaning the angle is between 0 and π/2.; answer - First quadrant.\nSub-task 3b2b output: thinking - We have determined that θ = -arctan(-37/28) is equivalent to arctan(37/28), which places it in the first quadrant. However, for complex numbers of the form (a+bi)z + (c+di)/z where |z| is constant, we often use the form z = re^(iθ) and consider the periodicity of the complex exponential function. Since we are dealing with |z| = 4, we have z = 4e^(iθ). The periodicity of the exponential function means that θ can be adjusted by adding multiples of 2π to remain in the same orientation. We need to finalize θ based on the quadrant information and periodicity, and ensure it is consistent with the conditions given. Since θ is in the first quadrant, and arctan(37/28) is already in the first quadrant, we do not need to adjust it by adding π or 2π. Therefore, θ = arctan(37/28) is the finalized angle.; answer - θ = arctan(37/28)&#34;]

We get (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ}). Simplifying, this becomes (300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ}) + (24e^{-iθ} + 36ie^{-iθ}). Now, we need to express this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Use Euler&#39;s formula: e^{iθ} = cos(θ) + i sin(θ) and e^{-iθ} = cos(θ) - i sin(θ). Substitute these into the expression and simplify to find the real part as a function of θ.; answer: The real part of the expression is 300cos(θ) + 36cos(θ) - 468sin(θ) + 24sin(θ), which simplifies to 336cos(θ) - 444sin(θ).\nCoT agent 8PvE, on calculating φ, thinking: We have the expression for the real part as 336cos(θ) - 444sin(θ). To find the maximum value, we can express it in the form Rcos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is a phase shift. The amplitude R is given by R = √(336^2 + 444^2), and tan(φ) = -444/336. However, the sub-task 3a asks for φ using tan(φ) = -432/324, which seems to be a typo or mistake, as it doesn&#39;t match the coefficients in the expression we found. Therefore, I will calculate φ using the correct coefficients: tan(φ) = -444/336.; answer: tan(φ) = -444/336 = -37/28\nφ = arctan(-37/28)\nCoT agent ab0o, on exploring the relationship between φ and θ, thinking: To maximize the real part of the expression 336cos(θ) - 444sin(θ), we should express it as Rcos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The amplitude R is calculated as R = √(336^2 + 444^2). The phase shift φ is calculated using tan(φ) = -444/336, which gives φ = arctan(-37/28). To maximize the expression Rcos(θ + φ), we need to set θ + φ = 0, which means θ = -φ. This is the condition to maximize the real part of the expression.; answer: The relationship between φ and θ to maximize the real part is θ = -φ.\nCoT agent q9uA, on calculating the adjustment needed for θ, thinking: From sub-task 3b1a, we determined that to maximize the real part of the expression, we need to set θ = -φ, where φ is the phase shift given by φ = arctan(-37/28). The adjustment needed for θ is to change it to -φ. Therefore, the adjustment needed for θ is simply to set θ to -φ, which is the negative of the calculated phase shift φ.; answer: Set θ to -arctan(-37/28) to maximize the real part.\nCoT agent QEJl, on determining the quadrant for θ, thinking: We have θ = -arctan(-37/28). The expression -arctan(-37/28) is equivalent to arctan(37/28), since -arctan(-x) = arctan(x). The angle arctan(37/28) is in the first quadrant because both 37 and 28 are positive, meaning the angle is between 0 and π/2.; answer: First quadrant.\nCoT agent yWrx, on finalizing θ based on quadrant and periodicity, thinking: We have determined that θ = -arctan(-37/28) is equivalent to arctan(37/28), which places it in the first quadrant. However, for complex numbers of the form (a+bi)z + (c+di)/z where |z| is constant, we often use the form z = re^(iθ) and consider the periodicity of the complex exponential function. Since we are dealing with |z| = 4, we have z = 4e^(iθ). The periodicity of the exponential function means that θ can be adjusted by adding multiples of 2π to remain in the same orientation. We need to finalize θ based on the quadrant information and periodicity, and ensure it is consistent with the conditions given. Since θ is in the first quadrant, and arctan(37/28) is already in the first quadrant, we do not need to adjust it by adding π or 2π. Therefore, θ = arctan(37/28) is the finalized angle.; answer: θ = arctan(37/28)&#34;]

final_reponse: [&#39;We have determined that θ = -arctan(-37/28) is equivalent to arctan(37/28), which places it in the first quadrant.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
- Sub-task 3b2b&#39;s final answer is incorrect, as indicated by the low fitness score. This suggests that the task is still too complex or not correctly approached. The issue seems to stem from an incorrect understanding of how to finalize θ based on quadrant and periodicity.
- Sub-task 3a and 3b1a correctly address the calculation of φ and its relationship with θ. However, there is a mismatch in coefficients in sub-task 3a, which should be addressed to ensure consistency.
- Sub-task 2 is correctly handled by the CoT block, providing the correct simplification of the expression.

(2) **Completeness:**
- The sub-tasks include necessary information from the original query, but the connection between sub-tasks needs further refinement. Specifically, sub-task 3b2b should address the quadrant issue and how to adjust θ based on the real part maximization.

(3) **Fitness:**
- The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The final response has not been updated and still gives the same mistaken answer. This suggests the need for further decomposition and improved sub-task instructions to avoid known incorrect answers.

**Improvements:**
- **Further Decomposition:** Sub-task 3b2b should be further decomposed to explicitly address the relationship between φ and θ, focusing on how to adjust θ to maximize the real part.

- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Add a note to sub-task 3b2b that known incorrect answers should be avoided, as indicated in the memory.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last Sub-task 3b2b -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3b2b1: Analyze the periodicity of θ, New Sub-task 3b2b2: Determine the final θ based on periodicity and quadrant.
    - Justification: By breaking down the tasks further, each sub-task becomes more focused and easier to solve. This ensures that θ is correctly calculated, taking into account the full range of possible angles and the relationship between φ and θ.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - Add to the instruction of the last sub-task: &#34;It is known that previous final answers, such as &#39;θ = -arctan(-432/324) + π&#39;, &#39;First quadrant&#39;, and &#39;θ = arctan(37/28)&#39; are not correct.&#34;

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The complex number z with |z|=4 can be represented in polar form as z = re^{iθ} where r = 4. Thus, z = 4e^{iθ}.; answer - z = 4e^{iθ}\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have z = 4e^{iθ}. We need to substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + \\frac{96+144i}{z} and find the real part as a function of θ. First, substitute z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression: (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + \\frac{96+144i}{4e^{iθ}}. Simplify this to get the expression in terms of θ.; answer - The expression becomes (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + \\frac{96+144i}{4e^{iθ}} = 300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ} + (24+36i)e^{-iθ}. Simplifying further, this is (300\\cosθ - 468\\sinθ) + i(300\\sinθ + 468\\cosθ) + (24\\cosθ + 36\\sinθ) + i(24\\sinθ - 36\\cosθ). The real part is 300\\cosθ - 468\\sinθ + 24\\cosθ + 36\\sinθ = 324\\cosθ - 432\\sinθ.\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - From sub-task 2, we have the expression for the real part as 324\\cosθ - 432\\sinθ. We can write this in the form R\\cos(θ + φ) by using the identity R\\cos(θ + φ) = R\\cosθ\\cosφ - R\\sinθ\\sinφ. Comparing coefficients, we have R\\cosφ = 324 and R\\sinφ = -432. Dividing these two equations gives \\tanφ = -432/324 = -4/3. We need to calculate φ using this tangent value.; answer - φ = \\tan^{-1}(-4/3)\nSub-task 3b1a output: thinking - To maximize the real part of the expression, we need to maximize Rcos(θ + φ). The maximum value of Rcos(θ + φ) is R, which occurs when θ + φ = 0 or an integer multiple of 2π. Therefore, to maximize the real part, θ should be chosen such that θ + φ = 0.; answer - To maximize the real part, set θ = -φ.\nSub-task 3b1b output: thinking - To align θ with maximizing the real part of the expression, we need to adjust θ such that θ = -φ, as derived from sub-task 3b1a. This adjustment ensures that the angle θ + φ equals zero, which maximizes the real part of the expression. The adjustment needed for θ is simply to negate φ, i.e., θ should be set to the negative of the phase angle φ.; answer - Set θ = -φ.\nSub-task 3b2a output: thinking - The adjustment in sub-task 3b1b indicates that θ should be set to -φ. The quadrant for θ depends on the value of φ. Since θ is the negative of φ, if φ is in the first quadrant (0 to π/2), then θ will be in the fourth quadrant (-π/2 to 0). If φ is in the second quadrant (π/2 to π), then θ will be in the third quadrant (-π to -π/2). If φ is in the third quadrant (π to 3π/2), then θ will be in the second quadrant (-3π/2 to -π). If φ is in the fourth quadrant (3π/2 to 2π), then θ will be in the first quadrant (0 to π/2). Without the specific value of φ, we cannot determine the exact quadrant for θ.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Determine the specific value of φ to find the exact quadrant for θ.\nSub-task 3b2b1 output: thinking - To analyze the periodicity of θ, we need to consider how the real part of the expression changes with θ. Since the expression involves terms like (75+117i)z and (96+144i)/z, where z is a complex number on the circle of radius 4, the real part of the expression will depend on the angle θ of z in polar form. The periodicity of θ is 2π, as it is the angle in polar coordinates. To maximize the real part, we need to find the specific angle θ that aligns with the maximum real part. However, without additional information or a specific value for φ, determining the exact angle or periodic alignment is challenging.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Determine the specific value of φ or analyze the expression to find the angle θ that maximizes the real part.\nSub-task 3b2b2 output: thinking - To determine the final θ based on periodicity and quadrant, we need to analyze how the real part of the given expression changes with θ. The expression is of the form (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, where z = 4e^{iθ}. The real part depends on the angle θ and involves trigonometric identities. The periodicity of θ is 2π, and we must consider how the real and imaginary coefficients interact to find the angle that maximizes the real part. Without explicit calculations or additional information, determining the exact angle is challenging. The previous attempts involving angles like &#39;θ = -arctan(-432/324) + π&#39; and &#39;θ = arctan(37/28)&#39; suggest attempts at finding when the derivative of the real part with respect to θ equals zero, but they were incorrect. A detailed analysis or different approach is needed to find the correct θ.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the expression by explicitly calculating the derivative of the real part with respect to θ and solving for critical points, ensuring the correct quadrant is considered.&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent usQW, on deriving parametric form of z, thinking: The complex number z with |z|=4 can be represented in polar form as z = re^{iθ} where r = 4. Thus, z = 4e^{iθ}.; answer: z = 4e^{iθ}\nCoT agent 829g, on substituting and simplifying, thinking: We have z = 4e^{iθ}. We need to substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + \\frac{96+144i}{z} and find the real part as a function of θ. First, substitute z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression: (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + \\frac{96+144i}{4e^{iθ}}. Simplify this to get the expression in terms of θ.; answer: The expression becomes (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + \\frac{96+144i}{4e^{iθ}} = 300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ} + (24+36i)e^{-iθ}. Simplifying further, this is (300\\cosθ - 468\\sinθ) + i(300\\sinθ + 468\\cosθ) + (24\\cosθ + 36\\sinθ) + i(24\\sinθ - 36\\cosθ). The real part is 300\\cosθ - 468\\sinθ + 24\\cosθ + 36\\sinθ = 324\\cosθ - 432\\sinθ.\nCoT agent NKQa, on calculating φ, thinking: From sub-task 2, we have the expression for the real part as 324\\cosθ - 432\\sinθ. We can write this in the form R\\cos(θ + φ) by using the identity R\\cos(θ + φ) = R\\cosθ\\cosφ - R\\sinθ\\sinφ. Comparing coefficients, we have R\\cosφ = 324 and R\\sinφ = -432. Dividing these two equations gives \\tanφ = -432/324 = -4/3. We need to calculate φ using this tangent value.; answer: φ = \\tan^{-1}(-4/3)\nCoT agent xIm5, on exploring the relationship between φ and θ, thinking: To maximize the real part of the expression, we need to maximize Rcos(θ + φ). The maximum value of Rcos(θ + φ) is R, which occurs when θ + φ = 0 or an integer multiple of 2π. Therefore, to maximize the real part, θ should be chosen such that θ + φ = 0.; answer: To maximize the real part, set θ = -φ.\nCoT agent qx7r, on calculating the adjustment needed for θ, thinking: To align θ with maximizing the real part of the expression, we need to adjust θ such that θ = -φ, as derived from sub-task 3b1a. This adjustment ensures that the angle θ + φ equals zero, which maximizes the real part of the expression. The adjustment needed for θ is simply to negate φ, i.e., θ should be set to the negative of the phase angle φ.; answer: Set θ = -φ.\nCoT agent oBG0, on determining the quadrant for θ, thinking: The adjustment in sub-task 3b1b indicates that θ should be set to -φ. The quadrant for θ depends on the value of φ. Since θ is the negative of φ, if φ is in the first quadrant (0 to π/2), then θ will be in the fourth quadrant (-π/2 to 0). If φ is in the second quadrant (π/2 to π), then θ will be in the third quadrant (-π to -π/2). If φ is in the third quadrant (π to 3π/2), then θ will be in the second quadrant (-3π/2 to -π). If φ is in the fourth quadrant (3π/2 to 2π), then θ will be in the first quadrant (0 to π/2). Without the specific value of φ, we cannot determine the exact quadrant for θ.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Determine the specific value of φ to find the exact quadrant for θ.\nCoT agent 7e6F, on analyzing the periodicity of θ, thinking: To analyze the periodicity of θ, we need to consider how the real part of the expression changes with θ.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
- Sub-task 3b2a and 3b2b1 both contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that these tasks are too complex for the current architecture. The suggestions indicate the need for a more detailed analysis of the relationship between φ and θ, and how periodicity affects the solution.
- Sub-task 3b2b2&#39;s final answer is incorrect, as indicated by the low fitness score. This suggests that the task is still too complex or not correctly approached.
- Sub-task 3a and 3b1a correctly address the calculation of φ and its relationship with θ, but there is a mismatch in coefficients in sub-task 3a, which should be addressed to ensure consistency.
- Sub-task 2 is correctly handled by the CoT block, providing the correct simplification of the expression.

(2) **Completeness:**
- The sub-tasks include necessary information from the original query, but the connection between sub-tasks needs further refinement. Specifically, sub-task 3b2b2 should address the quadrant issue and how to adjust θ based on the real part maximization.

(3) **Fitness:**
- The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The final response has not been updated and still gives the same mistaken answer. This suggests the need for further decomposition and improved sub-task instructions to avoid known incorrect answers.

**Improvements:**
- **Further Decomposition:** Sub-task 3b2b2 should be further decomposed to explicitly address the relationship between φ and θ, focusing on how to adjust θ to maximize the real part.

- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Add a note to sub-task 3b2b2 that known incorrect answers should be avoided, as indicated in the memory.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last Sub-task 3b2b2 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3b2b2a: Calculate the derivative of the real part with respect to θ, New Sub-task 3b2b2b: Solve for critical points to determine θ.
    - Justification: By breaking down the tasks further, each sub-task becomes more focused and easier to solve. This ensures that θ is correctly calculated, taking into account the full range of possible angles and the relationship between φ and θ.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - Add to the instruction of the last sub-task: &#34;It is known that previous final answers, such as &#39;θ = -arctan(-432/324) + π&#39;, &#39;First quadrant&#39;, and &#39;θ = arctan(37/28)&#39; are not correct.&#34;

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To find the parametric representation of a complex number z with |z|=4, we can express z in polar form. Since the magnitude of z is 4, we can write z as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the angle in radians that z makes with the positive real axis. This is a standard way to express a complex number with a given magnitude.; answer - z = 4e^{iθ}\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have the complex number z in polar form as z = 4e^{iθ}. We need to substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + \\frac{96+144i}{z} and simplify to find the real part as a function of θ. First, substitute z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression: (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + \\frac{96+144i}{4e^{iθ}}. This simplifies to (300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ}) + \\frac{24+36i}{e^{iθ}}. The second term can be written as (24+36i)e^{-iθ}. Now, express each term in terms of real and imaginary parts using Euler&#39;s formula: e^{iθ} = cos(θ) + i sin(θ) and e^{-iθ} = cos(θ) - i sin(θ). For the first term: 300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ} = 300(cos(θ) + i sin(θ)) + 468i(cos(θ) + i sin(θ)) = (300 cos(θ) - 468 sin(θ)) + i(300 sin(θ) + 468 cos(θ)). For the second term: (24+36i)e^{-iθ} = (24+36i)(cos(θ) - i sin(θ)) = (24 cos(θ) + 36 sin(θ)) + i(36 cos(θ) - 24 sin(θ)). Combine the real parts: 300 cos(θ) - 468 sin(θ) + 24 cos(θ) + 36 sin(θ) = (300 + 24) cos(θ) + (36 - 468) sin(θ) = 324 cos(θ) - 432 sin(θ). This is the real part as a function of θ.; answer - 324 cos(θ) - 432 sin(θ)\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - To find φ, we need to solve the equation tan(φ) = -444/336. This involves finding the angle φ whose tangent is -444/336. Simplifying -444/336 gives -37/28. We can calculate φ using the arctangent function: φ = arctan(-37/28). This will give us the angle φ in radians.; answer - arctan(-37/28)\nSub-task 3b1a output: thinking - To maximize the real part of the expression (75+117i)z+(96+144i)/z where |z|=4, we need to consider the relationship between the angles φ and θ. From sub-task 3a, we have φ = arctan(-37/28). If z = re^{iθ}, then the expression becomes a function of θ, and we need to find the value of θ that maximizes the real part. The real part will depend on the cosine of the difference between φ and θ. The maximum real part is achieved when cos(θ - φ) = 1, which implies θ = φ + 2kπ for some integer k.; answer - The real part is maximized when θ = φ + 2kπ, where φ = arctan(-37/28).\nSub-task 3b1b output: thinking - To maximize the real part of the expression, we need θ to be aligned such that cos(θ - φ) = 1. This occurs when θ = φ + 2kπ for some integer k. Since φ = arctan(-37/28), the adjustment needed for θ is simply to set it equal to φ modulo 2π. Therefore, θ should be adjusted to φ = arctan(-37/28), ensuring that θ = φ + 2kπ.; answer - Set θ to φ = arctan(-37/28) to maximize the real part.\nSub-task 3b2a output: thinking - The angle θ is set to φ = arctan(-37/28) based on the maximization condition. The tangent of an angle determines its location in the unit circle. Since the tangent is negative and arctan(-37/28) is in standard position, θ must be in either the second or fourth quadrant where cosine is positive and tangent is negative.; answer - Fourth quadrant\nSub-task 3b2b1 output: thinking - To calculate the derivative of the real part with respect to θ, we first need the expression for the real part in terms of θ. Given z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ), the expression for the real part becomes a function of θ. We need to differentiate this with respect to θ. However, the exact expression for the real part in terms of θ is not provided, making it difficult to directly compute the derivative.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide the expression for the real part of the given function in terms of θ to compute the derivative.\nSub-task 3b2b2 output: thinking - To solve for critical points of θ, we need the expression for the real part of the given function in terms of θ. The expression involves z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ) and its reciprocal, which is 1/z = (1/4)(cos θ - i sin θ). The real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z can be found by substituting z and 1/z and simplifying. However, the exact expression for the real part in terms of θ is not provided, making it difficult to find the critical points directly. Without this expression, solving for θ is challenging.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide the expression for the real part of the function in terms of θ, or simplify the expression to find the derivative and solve for critical points.&#34;]

Since the magnitude of z is 4, we can write z as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the angle in radians that z makes with the positive real axis.

First, substitute z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression: (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + \\frac{96+144i}{4e^{iθ}}. This simplifies to (300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ}) + \\frac{24+36i}{e^{iθ}}. The second term can be written as (24+36i)e^{-iθ}. Now, express each term in terms of real and imaginary parts using Euler&#39;s formula: e^{iθ} = cos(θ) + i sin(θ) and e^{-iθ} = cos(θ) - i sin(θ). For the first term: 300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ} = 300(cos(θ) + i sin(θ)) + 468i(cos(θ) + i sin(θ)) = (300 cos(θ) - 468 sin(θ)) + i(300 sin(θ) + 468 cos(θ)). For the second term: (24+36i)e^{-iθ} = (24+36i)(cos(θ) - i sin(θ)) = (24 cos(θ) + 36 sin(θ)) + i(36 cos(θ) - 24 sin(θ)). Combine the real parts: 300 cos(θ) - 468 sin(θ) + 24 cos(θ) + 36 sin(θ) = (300 + 24) cos(θ) + (36 - 468) sin(θ) = 324 cos(θ) - 432 sin(θ).

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
- Sub-task 3b2b1 and 3b2b2 both contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that these tasks are too complex for the current architecture. The suggestions indicate the need for a more detailed analysis of the real part expression and its derivative to find critical points.
- Sub-task 3b1b and 3b2a have incorrect assumptions about the quadrant and adjustment needed for θ, leading to incorrect sub-task answers.
- Sub-task 3a and 3b1a correctly address the calculation of φ and its relationship with θ, but there is a mismatch in coefficients in sub-task 3a, which should be addressed to ensure consistency.
- Sub-task 2 is correctly handled by the CoT block, providing the correct simplification of the expression.

(2) **Completeness:**
- The sub-tasks include necessary information from the original query, but the connection between sub-tasks needs further refinement. Specifically, sub-task 3b2b2 should address the quadrant issue and how to adjust θ based on the real part maximization.

(3) **Fitness:**
- The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The final response has not been updated and still gives the same mistaken answer. This suggests the need for further decomposition and improved sub-task instructions to avoid known incorrect answers.

**Improvements:**
- **Further Decomposition:** Sub-task 3b2b2 should be further decomposed to explicitly address the relationship between φ and θ, focusing on how to adjust θ to maximize the real part.

- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Add a note to sub-task 3b2b2 that known incorrect answers should be avoided, as indicated in the memory.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last Sub-task 3b2b2 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3b2b2a: Re-evaluate the expression for the real part in terms of θ, New Sub-task 3b2b2b: Calculate the derivative of the real part with respect to θ, New Sub-task 3b2b2c: Solve for critical points to determine θ.
    - Justification: By breaking down the tasks further, each sub-task becomes more focused and easier to solve. This ensures that θ is correctly calculated, taking into account the full range of possible angles and the relationship between φ and θ.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - Add to the instruction of the last sub-task: &#34;It is known that previous final answers, such as &#39;θ = -arctan(-432/324) + π&#39;, &#39;First quadrant&#39;, and &#39;θ = arctan(37/28)&#39; are not correct.&#34;

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To find the parametric representation of a complex number z with |z|=4, we can express z in polar form. A complex number z with modulus 4 can be written as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of the complex number. This representation satisfies the condition |z|=4, as the modulus of 4e^{iθ} is 4.; answer - z = 4e^{iθ}\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We are given that z = 4e^{iθ} and need to substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. Substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, we have z = 4(cosθ + isinθ). The expression becomes (75 + 117i)(4(cosθ + isinθ)) + (96 + 144i)/(4(cosθ + isinθ)). We simplify each term separately. For the first term, (75 + 117i)(4(cosθ + isinθ)) = 300cosθ + 300isinθ + 468icosθ - 468sinθ. This simplifies to (300cosθ - 468sinθ) + i(300sinθ + 468cosθ). For the second term, (96 + 144i)/(4(cosθ + isinθ)) can be simplified by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: (96 + 144i)(4(cosθ) - 4isinθ) / (16(cos^2θ + sin^2θ)) = (96(4cosθ) + 144(4isinθ) - 96(4isinθ) + 144(4cosθ)) / 16 = (384cosθ + 576cosθ + i(576sinθ - 384sinθ)) / 16 = (960cosθ + i192sinθ) / 16 = 60cosθ + i12sinθ. The real part of the entire expression is then (300cosθ - 468sinθ) + 60cosθ = 360cosθ - 468sinθ.; answer - 360cosθ - 468sinθ\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - We have the expression 360cosθ - 468sinθ, which can be represented in the form Rcos(θ + φ) by using the identity Rcos(θ + φ) = R(cosθcosφ - sinθsinφ). To find φ, we use tan(φ) = sinφ/cosφ = -468/360. Simplifying this gives tan(φ) = -13/10. We can calculate φ using the arctangent function: φ = arctan(-13/10).; answer - φ = arctan(-13/10)\nSub-task 3b1a output: thinking - We are given that the expression can be written as Rcos(θ + φ) with R = 360 and tan(φ) = -13/10. To maximize the real part, we need to maximize Rcos(θ + φ). The maximum value of cos(θ + φ) is 1, which occurs when θ + φ = 0. Therefore, to maximize the real part, we should set θ = -φ.; answer - Set θ = -arctan(-13/10) to maximize the real part.\nSub-task 3b1b output: thinking - To maximize the real part of the expression, we need to set θ = -φ, where φ is determined by tan(φ) = -13/10. Therefore, θ should be set to -arctan(-13/10). This adjustment aligns θ with the angle that maximizes the real part of the expression.; answer - Set θ = -arctan(-13/10).\nSub-task 3b2a output: thinking - We need to determine the quadrant of θ = -arctan(-13/10). The arctan function returns angles in the range (-π/2, π/2), corresponding to quadrants I and IV. Since the argument of arctan is negative, -arctan(-13/10) will be positive, placing θ in quadrant I.; answer - Quadrant I\nSub-task 3b2b1 output: thinking - We need to re-evaluate the expression for the real part of (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, where z = 4e^{iθ} and θ is in quadrant I. The expression simplifies using the properties of complex conjugates and Euler&#39;s formula. Since θ is in quadrant I, cos(θ) &gt; 0 and sin(θ) &gt; 0, which affects the real part calculation.; answer - The real part of the expression is 300cos(θ) - 18sin(θ).\nSub-task 3b2b2 output: thinking - To find the derivative of the real part 300cos(θ) - 18sin(θ) with respect to θ, we apply standard differentiation rules for trigonometric functions. The derivative of cos(θ) is -sin(θ) and the derivative of sin(θ) is cos(θ).; answer - -300sin(θ) - 18cos(θ)\nSub-task 3b2b3 output: thinking - To find the critical points, we need to set the derivative of the real part with respect to θ to zero. The derivative is -300sin(θ) - 18cos(θ). Setting this equal to zero gives us the equation -300sin(θ) - 18cos(θ) = 0. This can be rewritten as 300sin(θ) = -18cos(θ), or sin(θ)/cos(θ) = -18/300, which simplifies to tan(θ) = -3/50. Solving for θ gives θ = arctan(-3/50).; answer - θ = arctan(-3/50)&#34;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

- The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The current decomposition and architecture need to ensure that the final response is accurate. The key issue seems to be in the final determination of θ, which needs to be corrected.

**Improvements:**
- **Improved Subtask Architecture:** The final sub-task 3b2b3 should be updated to ensure that it correctly calculates θ based on the derivative and critical point analysis. This may involve refining the calculation method or ensuring that the correct quadrant and periodicity are considered.

- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Add a note to sub-task 3b2b3 that known incorrect answers should be avoided, as indicated in the memory.

thought: 
    **Improved Subtask Architecture:**
    - Last sub-task architecture (Chain-of-Thought for sub-task 3b2b3) -&gt; (improve to) New sub-task architecture (Self-Refine for sub-task 3b2b3).
    - Justification: By using a Self-Refine architecture, the model can iteratively improve upon its initial calculation of θ, allowing it to refine its approach based on feedback and potentially converge on the correct answer.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - Add to the instruction of the last sub-task: &#34;It is known that previous final answers, such as &#39;θ = -arctan(-432/324) + π&#39;, &#39;First quadrant&#39;, &#39;θ = arctan(37/28)&#39;, and &#39;θ = arctan(-3/50)&#39; are not correct.&#34;

Thus, the critical points in this range are \\(\\theta = 0\\) and \\(\\theta = \\pi\\).; answer: 0, \\pi\nCritic agent ZH7V, on reviewing critical points, feedback: The reasoning provided is correct in identifying the critical points based on the condition that the derivative of the real part with respect to \\( \\theta \\) is zero. The derivative \\(-324\\sin(\\theta)\\) leads to \\(\\sin(\\theta) = 0\\), which indeed gives the solutions \\(\\theta = 0\\) and \\(\\theta = \\pi\\) within the interval \\([0, 2\\pi)\\). Therefore, the answer provided is correct.; correct: True&#39;]

final_reponse: [&#39;To find the critical points, we need to solve the equation where the derivative is zero. The derivative of the real part with respect to \\( \\theta \\) is \\(-324\\sin(\\theta)\\). Setting this equal to zero gives \\(-324\\sin(\\theta) = 0\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sin(\\theta) = 0\\). The solutions to \\(\\sin(\\theta) = 0\\) are \\(\\theta = n\\pi\\) for \\(n\\) being any integer. Since \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), \\(\\theta\\) is typically considered in the range \\([0, 2\\pi)\\). Thus, the critical points in this range are \\(\\theta = 0\\) and \\(\\theta = \\pi\\).\n\nAnswer:0, \\pi&#39;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
- The sub-tasks have been decomposed into manageable parts, but Sub-task 3a and 3b1a contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; indicating they are still too complex. The calculation of φ using tan(φ) = -4/3 needs to be verified and simplified further to ensure correctness.
- Sub-task 3b2b3&#39;s final response is incorrect, and the critical points identified (θ = 0, π) do not align with the expected solution, suggesting a deeper issue in the calculation or interpretation of the derivative.

(2) **Completeness:**
- The sub-tasks include necessary information from the original query, but the connection between sub-tasks needs further refinement to ensure the correct final answer. Specifically, the calculation of φ and the identification of critical points need more clarity.

(3) **Fitness:**
- The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The current decomposition and architecture need to ensure that the final response is accurate. The key issue seems to be in the calculation of φ and the determination of critical points for θ.

**Improvements:**
- **Further Decomposition:** Sub-task 3a needs further decomposition to verify the calculation of φ. Sub-task 3b2b3 should be further refined to ensure the correct identification of critical points, possibly by breaking it down into more detailed steps.

- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Add a note to sub-task 3b2b3 that known incorrect answers should be avoided, as indicated in the memory.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last Sub-task 3a -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3a1: Verify the calculation of φ using tan(φ) = -4/3, New Sub-task 3a2: Simplify the expression for φ.
    - Last Sub-task 3b2b3 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3b2b3a: Re-evaluate the critical points for θ, New Sub-task 3b2b3b: Verify the critical points using derivative analysis.
    - Justification: By breaking down the tasks further, each sub-task becomes more focused and easier to solve. This ensures that φ is correctly calculated and that the critical points for θ are accurately identified.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - Add to the instruction of the last sub-task: &#34;It is known that previous final answers, such as &#39;θ = -arctan(-432/324) + π&#39;, &#39;First quadrant&#39;, &#39;θ = arctan(37/28)&#39;, &#39;θ = arctan(-3/50)&#39;, and &#39;0, π&#39; are not correct.&#34;

Substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, we get (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + \\frac{96+144i}{4e^{iθ}}. Simplifying, we have 300e^{iθ} + 468ie^{iθ} + \\frac{24}{e^{iθ}} + \\frac{36i}{e^{iθ}}. This can be rewritten as (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

To find the maximum value of this expression, we can use the method of expressing it in the form Rcos(θ - φ), where R is the magnitude and φ is the angle such that tan(φ) = b/a for a term a*cos(θ) + b*sin(θ). Here, a = 324 and b = 432. So, tan(φ) = 432/324 = 4/3. However, the problem asks to verify the calculation of φ using tan(φ) = -4/3, which seems to be a contradiction because we found tan(φ) = 4/3. This discrepancy suggests a misunderstanding or error in the problem statement or previous calculations.; answer - tan(φ) = 4/3, not -4/3.\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Verify if the problem statement or previous calculations have an error regarding the sign of tan(φ).\nSub-task 3a2 output: thinking - The expression involves finding the angle φ such that tan(φ) = 4/3. Typically, φ can be found using the arctangent function: φ = arctan(4/3). The previous task suggests a misunderstanding regarding the sign of tan(φ), which was clarified to be positive 4/3. Therefore, φ should be simplified as φ = arctan(4/3).; answer - φ = arctan(4/3)\nSub-task 3b2b3a output: thinking - The task is to find critical points for θ based on the angle φ = arctan(4/3). Since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, it can be expressed as z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ). The expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z can be simplified using this form of z. The critical points for θ occur when the derivative of the real part of this expression with respect to θ is zero. This requires calculating the real part of the expression and differentiating with respect to θ, which involves trigonometric identities and potentially complex calculations. Without further simplification or specific values, the task may be too complex.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Calculate the real part of the given expression as a function of θ and find where its derivative is zero to determine the critical points for θ.\nSub-task 3b2b3b output: thinking - To verify the critical points using derivative analysis, we need to find the real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z as a function of θ, where z = 4(cos θ + i sin θ). The real part is given by 75 * 4 * cos θ + 117 * 4 * sin θ + 96/4 * cos θ - 144/4 * sin θ. Simplifying, we have (75 * 4 + 96/4) cos θ + (117 * 4 - 144/4) sin θ. We need to differentiate this with respect to θ and set the derivative to zero to find critical points. This results in a trigonometric function that needs to be solved for θ. The problem is complex, and without detailed calculations, it&#39;s challenging to verify critical points accurately. The previous incorrect answers suggest a need for careful trigonometric analysis and possibly numerical methods.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Carefully compute the derivative of the real part with respect to θ, set it to zero, and solve for θ to find the critical points. Consider using numerical methods or software for solving trigonometric equations if necessary.&#34;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
- The sub-tasks 3a1 and 3b2b3a contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating these tasks are still too complex. The calculation of φ using tan(φ) = -4/3 needs to be re-evaluated, and the critical points for θ need a more detailed analysis.
- Sub-task 3b2b3b&#39;s final response is incorrect, indicating a deeper issue in the calculation or interpretation of the derivative. The current approach to finding critical points is not yielding the correct results.

(2) **Completeness:**
- The sub-tasks cover the necessary aspects of the original query, but the connection between sub-tasks needs further refinement to ensure the correct final answer. Specifically, the calculation of φ and the identification of critical points need more clarity and accuracy.

(3) **Fitness:**
- The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The current decomposition and architecture need to ensure that the final response is accurate. The key issue seems to be in the calculation of φ and the determination of critical points for θ.

**Improvements:**
- **Further Decomposition:** Sub-task 3a1 needs further decomposition to verify the calculation of φ. Sub-task 3b2b3b should be further refined to ensure the correct identification of critical points, possibly by breaking it down into more detailed steps.

- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Add a note to sub-task 3b2b3b that known incorrect answers should be avoided, as indicated in the memory.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last Sub-task 3a1 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3a1a: Verify the calculation of φ using tan(φ) = -4/3, New Sub-task 3a1b: Simplify the expression for φ using trigonometric identities.
    - Last Sub-task 3b2b3b -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3b2b3b1: Analyze the derivative of the real part with respect to θ, New Sub-task 3b2b3b2: Solve for critical points using numerical methods.
    - Justification: By breaking down the tasks further, each sub-task becomes more focused and easier to solve. This ensures that φ is correctly calculated and that the critical points for θ are accurately identified.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - Add to the instruction of the last sub-task: &#34;It is known that previous final answers, such as &#39;θ = -arctan(-432/324) + π&#39;, &#39;First quadrant&#39;, &#39;θ = arctan(37/28)&#39;, &#39;θ = arctan(-3/50)&#39;, and &#39;0, π&#39; are not correct.&#34;

A complex number z with modulus 4 can be written as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. This is because for any complex number z = re^{iθ}, the modulus |z| is r, and here we have |z|=4, so r=4.; answer - z = 4e^{iθ}\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have z = 4e^{iθ}, so we substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. We have z = 4(cosθ + i sinθ) and 1/z = 1/4(cosθ - i sinθ). Substitute these into the expression and simplify to find the real part as a function of θ.; answer - Substitute z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression: (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ}).\n\nThis becomes: (75+117i)(4(cosθ + i sinθ)) + (96+144i)(1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ).\n\nSimplify each part:\n\nPart 1: (75+117i)(4(cosθ + i sinθ)) = 4(75cosθ - 117sinθ + i(75sinθ + 117cosθ)).\n\nPart 2: (96+144i)(1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ) = (24cosθ + 36sinθ + i(-24sinθ + 36cosθ)).\n\nCombine the real parts: 4(75cosθ - 117sinθ) + 24cosθ + 36sinθ.\n\nThe real part is: 300cosθ - 468sinθ + 24cosθ + 36sinθ = (300 + 24)cosθ + (-468 + 36)sinθ = 324cosθ - 432sinθ.\n\nReal part as a function of θ: 324cosθ - 432sinθ.\nSub-task 3a1a output: thinking - We have the expression for the real part as 324cosθ - 432sinθ. To maximize this, we can express it in the form Rcos(θ + φ). We use the identity Rcos(θ + φ) = R(cosθcosφ - sinθsinφ) and match it to 324cosθ - 432sinθ. We find R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) and tan(φ) = -432/324 = -4/3. We need to verify tan(φ) = -4/3 and calculate φ accordingly.; answer - tan(φ) = -4/3. φ = arctan(-4/3) = -53.13 degrees or -0.927 radians.\nSub-task 3a1b output: thinking - We have φ = arctan(-4/3). We can use trigonometric identities to express φ in a simplified form. Since arctan(-4/3) is the angle whose tangent is -4/3, we can express this angle in terms of sine and cosine. We know that for an angle φ, tan(φ) = sin(φ)/cos(φ). Therefore, if tan(φ) = -4/3, we can set sin(φ) = -4k and cos(φ) = 3k for some k such that (sin(φ))^2 + (cos(φ))^2 = 1. Solving this gives k = 1/5, so sin(φ) = -4/5 and cos(φ) = 3/5. Thus, φ can be simplified using these values.; answer - sin(φ) = -4/5, cos(φ) = 3/5\nSub-task 3b2b3b1 output: thinking - To analyze the derivative of the real part with respect to θ, we need to express the real part of the given expression in terms of θ. We have z = 4(cos(θ) + i sin(θ)) since |z| = 4. The expression is (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. To find the real part, we substitute z = 4e^(iθ) and simplify. The derivative of the real part with respect to θ will involve differentiating this expression. However, without explicit simplification of the expression in terms of θ, analyzing the derivative is too complex.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Simplify the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z in terms of θ first, then compute the derivative of the real part with respect to θ.\nSub-task 3b2b3b2 output: thinking - The task requires finding critical points for the real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z where |z| = 4, expressed in terms of θ. To do this, we need to express the real part in terms of θ, differentiate it with respect to θ, and find where the derivative is zero. However, the previous sub-task indicates that the expression has not been simplified in terms of θ, making it difficult to directly apply numerical methods. Without a simplified form, numerical methods cannot be effectively used to find critical points. Additionally, the incorrectness of previous attempts suggests that the problem might be complex. Therefore, further simplification or transformation into a solvable form is necessary before applying numerical methods.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Simplify the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z in terms of θ to find the real part, then compute the derivative and use numerical methods to find where it is zero.&#39;]

Substitute these into the expression and simplify to find the real part as a function of θ.; answer: Substitute z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression: (75+117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ}).\n\nThis becomes: (75+117i)(4(cosθ + i sinθ)) + (96+144i)(1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ).\n\nSimplify each part:\n\nPart 1: (75+117i)(4(cosθ + i sinθ)) = 4(75cosθ - 117sinθ + i(75sinθ + 117cosθ)).\n\nPart 2: (96+144i)(1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ) = (24cosθ + 36sinθ + i(-24sinθ + 36cosθ)).\n\nCombine the real parts: 4(75cosθ - 117sinθ) + 24cosθ + 36sinθ.\n\nThe real part is: 300cosθ - 468sinθ + 24cosθ + 36sinθ = (300 + 24)cosθ + (-468 + 36)sinθ = 324cosθ - 432sinθ.\n\nReal part as a function of θ: 324cosθ - 432sinθ.\nCoT agent oXjS, on verifying φ, thinking: We have the expression for the real part as 324cosθ - 432sinθ. To maximize this, we can express it in the form Rcos(θ + φ). We use the identity Rcos(θ + φ) = R(cosθcosφ - sinθsinφ) and match it to 324cosθ - 432sinθ. We find R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) and tan(φ) = -432/324 = -4/3. We need to verify tan(φ) = -4/3 and calculate φ accordingly.; answer: tan(φ) = -4/3. φ = arctan(-4/3) = -53.13 degrees or -0.927 radians.\nCoT agent 24ug, on simplifying φ, thinking: We have φ = arctan(-4/3). We can use trigonometric identities to express φ in a simplified form. Since arctan(-4/3) is the angle whose tangent is -4/3, we can express this angle in terms of sine and cosine. We know that for an angle φ, tan(φ) = sin(φ)/cos(φ). Therefore, if tan(φ) = -4/3, we can set sin(φ) = -4k and cos(φ) = 3k for some k such that (sin(φ))^2 + (cos(φ))^2 = 1. Solving this gives k = 1/5, so sin(φ) = -4/5 and cos(φ) = 3/5. Thus, φ can be simplified using these values.; answer: sin(φ) = -4/5, cos(φ) = 3/5\nCoT agent Qgy4, on analyzing derivative, thinking: To analyze the derivative of the real part with respect to θ, we need to express the real part of the given expression in terms of θ. We have z = 4(cos(θ) + i sin(θ)) since |z| = 4. The expression is (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. To find the real part, we substitute z = 4e^(iθ) and simplify. The derivative of the real part with respect to θ will involve differentiating this expression. However, without explicit simplification of the expression in terms of θ, analyzing the derivative is too complex.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Simplify the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z in terms of θ first, then compute the derivative of the real part with respect to θ.\nCoT agent xqUO, on solving for critical points, thinking: The task requires finding critical points for the real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z where |z| = 4, expressed in terms of θ. To do this, we need to express the real part in terms of θ, differentiate it with respect to θ, and find where the derivative is zero. However, the previous sub-task indicates that the expression has not been simplified in terms of θ, making it difficult to directly apply numerical methods. Without a simplified form, numerical methods cannot be effectively used to find critical points. Additionally, the incorrectness of previous attempts suggests that the problem might be complex. Therefore, further simplification or transformation into a solvable form is necessary before applying numerical methods.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Simplify the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z in terms of θ to find the real part, then compute the derivative and use numerical methods to find where it is zero.&#39;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) **Solvable:**
- Sub-tasks 3b2b3b1 and 3b2b3b2 still contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating these tasks are too complex. The problem lies in simplifying the expression for the real part in terms of θ and then analyzing the derivative. This suggests that the decomposition needs further refinement.
- Sub-task 3a1a also contains &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that verifying the calculation of φ is problematic. The task is not solvable in its current form and requires further breakdown to ensure clarity in calculations.

(2) **Completeness:**
- The sub-tasks cover the necessary aspects of the original query, but the connection between sub-tasks needs further refinement to ensure the correct final answer. Specifically, the calculation of φ and the identification of critical points need more clarity and accuracy.

(3) **Fitness:**
- The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The current decomposition and architecture need to ensure that the final response is accurate. The key issue seems to be in the calculation of φ and the determination of critical points for θ.

**Improvements:**
- **Further Decomposition:** Sub-task 3a1a needs further decomposition to verify the calculation of φ. Sub-task 3b2b3b1 should be further refined to ensure the correct identification of critical points, possibly by breaking it down into more detailed steps.

- **Updated Subtask Instruction:** Add a note to sub-task 3b2b3b2 that known incorrect answers should be avoided, as indicated in the memory.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last Sub-task 3a1a -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3a1a1: Break down the calculation of φ using tan(φ) = -4/3 into smaller trigonometric steps, New Sub-task 3a1a2: Verify each step to ensure correctness.
    - Last Sub-task 3b2b3b1 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3b2b3b1a: Simplify the expression for the real part in terms of θ, New Sub-task 3b2b3b1b: Analyze the derivative with respect to θ.
    - Justification: By breaking down the tasks further, each sub-task becomes more focused and easier to solve. This ensures that φ is correctly calculated and that the critical points for θ are accurately identified.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - Add to the instruction of the last sub-task: &#34;It is known that previous final answers, such as &#39;θ = -arctan(-432/324) + π&#39;, &#39;First quadrant&#39;, &#39;θ = arctan(37/28)&#39;, &#39;θ = arctan(-3/50)&#39;, and &#39;0, π&#39; are not correct.&#34;
