Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)\n\nYour objective is to \n\n(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like 'output exactly the following...' is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.\n\nMake sure \n\n(a) Include sub-task ID  and 'Based on (task i)' in the instruction of a sub-task. \nFor example, \nSimilarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2's instruction should be\n'Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1's instruction)'\n\nSimilarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3's instruction should be\n'Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3's instruction)'\nThis helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task \nFor example,\n`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`\nYou can see it clearly states 'based on what sub-tasks'\n\n(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. \n\n(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. \nYou should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.\n\nFor example, if the exising architectures are 'COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate' and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:\n\nExample Setup\n\nResulting sub-tasks:\nsub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4\n\nAvailable architectures:\nCOT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate\n\nNetwork with 3 Layers:\n\nLayer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  \nLayer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   \nLayer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  \n\nConnection Strategies:\n\n1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.\nExample: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -> [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)\n\n2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.\nExample: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -> [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -> [COT -> Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -> Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\n1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.\n\n2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. \n\nYour aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the 'code' entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\n\n\n# The utility code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom typing import Union\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\n\nimport openai\nimport backoff\nfrom utils import random_id\n\n# Initialize the OpenAI client\nclient = openai.OpenAI()\n\n# Named tuple for holding task information\nInfo = namedtuple('Info', ['name', 'author', 'content', 'prompt', 'sub_tasks', 'agents', 'iteration_idx'])\n\n# Format instructions for LLM response\nFORMAT_INST = lambda request_keys: f\"Reply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{str(request_keys)}\nDO NOT MISS ANY FIELDS AND MAKE SURE THE JSON FORMAT IS CORRECT!\n\"\n\n# Description of the role for the LLM\nROLE_DESC = lambda role: f\"You are a {role}.\"\n\n@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, openai.RateLimitError)\ndef get_json_response_from_gpt(msg, model, system_message, temperature=0.5):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to get JSON response from GPT model.\n    \n    Args:\n    - msg (str): The user message.\n    - model (str): The model to use.\n    - system_message (str): The system message.\n    - temperature (float): Sampling temperature.\n    \n    Returns:\n    - dict: The JSON response.\n    \"\"\"\n    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_message},\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": msg},\n        ],\n        temperature=temperature,\n        max_tokens=1024,\n        stop=None,\n        response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n    )\n    content = response.choices[0].message.content\n    json_dict = json.loads(content)\n    return json_dict\n\nclass LLMAgentBase():\n    \"\"\"\n    Attributes:\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, output_fields: list, agent_name: str,\n                 role='helpful assistant', model=None, temperature=None) -> None:\n        self.output_fields = output_fields\n        self.agent_name = agent_name\n\n        self.role = role\n        self.model = model\n        self.temperature = temperature\n        #

You can get the content by Infos.content. \nDO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.\n\n\n## WRONG Implementation examples:\nHere are some mistakes you may make:\n\n1. This is WRONG: ```\nfeedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)\nfeedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)\n```\nIt is wrong to use \"Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)\". The returned \"feedback\" from LLMAgentBase is already Info.\n\n2. This is WRONG: ```\n# Debugging: Log the generated answer\nprint('Generated Answer:', ...)\nfeedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)\nif len(feedback_info) < 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements\n    return 'Error: Feedback info incomplete'\n```\nFirst, the len(feedback_info) will not work.\nSecond, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.\nThird, you should never print anything in the code.\nLastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.\n\n3. This is WRONG: ```\nall_thinking = []\nall_answers = []\nfor agent, role in zip(agents, roles):\n    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))\n    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)\n    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)\n\n# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers\naggregated_thinking = '\n'.join(all_thinking)\naggregated_answers = '\n'.join(all_answers)\n```\nYou SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.\n\n4. This is WRONG: ```\nreasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')\nresponse_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\n    \n# Extract the final answer from the response_infos\nfor info in response_infos:\n    if info.name == 'final_answer':\n        return info\n# Fallback if no answer is found\nreturn Info('answer', 'Final Decision Agent', 'No answer generated.', 0)\n```\n\n5. This is WRONG: ```\nreasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')\nthinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\nreturn answer   \n```\nYou MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.\n\n6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```\nthinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\n```\nYou MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition\n\n7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```\nreasoning_instruction = '...'\n```\nYou MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks\n\n\nYou should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.\nCORRECT example: ```\nreasoning_instruction = 'Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....'\nreasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')\nthinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\nfinal_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)\n\n# Return only the final answer\nreturn final_answer   \n```\n\n\n\n# Your task\nYou are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature.

            "thought": "To solve the complex question of finding the largest possible real part of the given expression, we can decompose the problem into simpler sub-tasks that can be effectively handled by the existing architectures. The expression involves a complex number with a modulus constraint, which suggests a geometric interpretation. The task can be broken down as follows:\n\n**Decomposition:**\n1. **Sub-task 1:** Determine the parametric representation of the complex number $z$ given $|z|=4$. This involves expressing $z$ in terms of a parameter $\\theta$ such that $z = 4e^{i\\theta}$.\n2. **Sub-task 2:** Substitute the parametric form of $z$ into the original expression and simplify it to express the real part as a function of $\\theta$.\n3. **Sub-task 3:** Analyze the function obtained in Sub-task 2 to find the value of $\\theta$ that maximizes the real part.\n\nThis decomposition ensures each sub-task is manageable and can be addressed using a specific architecture. The first sub-task is straightforward and involves basic complex number manipulation. The second sub-task requires algebraic manipulation and simplification, which can be handled by a reasoning agent. The third sub-task involves optimization, which can be tackled using a debate-based approach to explore different reasoning paths and converge on the optimal solution.\n\n**Overall Architecture:**\n- **Sub-task 1:** Use the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) block to derive the parametric form of $z$.\n- **Sub-task 2:** Use the Self-Refine (Reflexion) block to substitute and simplify the expression, as it can iteratively refine the algebraic manipulation.\n- **Sub-task 3:** Use the LLM Debate block to explore and debate different reasoning paths for maximizing the real part, ensuring convergence to the optimal solution.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Implement CoT for Sub-task 1 to derive $z = 4e^{i\\theta}$.\n2. Implement Reflexion for Sub-task 2 to substitute and simplify the expression.\n3. Implement LLM Debate for Sub-task 3 to find the optimal $\\theta$.\n\nThis architecture leverages the strengths of each block in handling specific aspects of the problem, ensuring a robust solution.",

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture.

The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect.

Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one.

Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture.

Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue.

Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer?

Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?)

Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture.

Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f'').

                "Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem asks for the parametric representation of a complex number z given that |z| = 4. A complex number z with a given magnitude can be represented in polar form. Since |z| = 4, we can write z as 4 times a unit complex number on the unit circle. The unit complex number can be represented as e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the angle in radians. Therefore, we can express z as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. This is a standard way to represent complex numbers with a given magnitude.; answer - z = 4e^{i\u03b8}\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, so substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. We get (75+117i)(4e^{i\u03b8}) + (96+144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}). Simplifying, this becomes (300e^{i\u03b8} + 468ie^{i\u03b8}) + (24e^{-i\u03b8} + 36ie^{-i\u03b8}). Now, we need to express this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Use Euler's formula: e^{i\u03b8} = cos(\u03b8) + i sin(\u03b8) and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos(\u03b8) - i sin(\u03b8). Substitute these into the expression and simplify to find the real part as a function of \u03b8.; answer - The real part of the expression is 300cos(\u03b8) + 36cos(\u03b8) - 468sin(\u03b8) + 24sin(\u03b8), which simplifies to 336cos(\u03b8) - 444sin(\u03b8).\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - We have the expression for the real part as 336cos(\u03b8) - 444sin(\u03b8). To find the maximum value, we can express it in the form Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude and \u03c6 is a phase shift. The amplitude R is given by R = \u221a(336^2 + 444^2), and tan(\u03c6) = -444/336. However, the sub-task 3a asks for \u03c6 using tan(\u03c6) = -432/324, which seems to be a typo or mistake, as it doesn't match the coefficients in the expression we found. Therefore, I will calculate \u03c6 using the correct coefficients: tan(\u03c6) = -444/336.; answer - tan(\u03c6) = -444/336 = -37/28\n\u03c6 = arctan(-37/28)\nSub-task 3b1a output: thinking - To maximize the real part of the expression 336cos(\u03b8) - 444sin(\u03b8), we should express it as Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude and \u03c6 is the phase shift. The amplitude R is calculated as R = \u221a(336^2 + 444^2). The phase shift \u03c6 is calculated using tan(\u03c6) = -444/336, which gives \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28). To maximize the expression Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), we need to set \u03b8 + \u03c6 = 0, which means \u03b8 = -\u03c6. This is the condition to maximize the real part of the expression.; answer - The relationship between \u03c6 and \u03b8 to maximize the real part is \u03b8 = -\u03c6.\nSub-task 3b1b output: thinking - From sub-task 3b1a, we determined that to maximize the real part of the expression, we need to set \u03b8 = -\u03c6, where \u03c6 is the phase shift given by \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28). The adjustment needed for \u03b8 is to change it to -\u03c6. Therefore, the adjustment needed for \u03b8 is simply to set \u03b8 to -\u03c6, which is the negative of the calculated phase shift \u03c6.; answer - Set \u03b8 to -arctan(-37/28) to maximize the real part.\nSub-task 3b2a output: thinking - We have \u03b8 = -arctan(-37/28). The expression -arctan(-37/28) is equivalent to arctan(37/28), since -arctan(-x) = arctan(x). The angle arctan(37/28) is in the first quadrant because both 37 and 28 are positive, meaning the angle is between 0 and \u03c0/2.; answer - First quadrant.\nSub-task 3b2b output: thinking - We have determined that \u03b8 = -arctan(-37/28) is equivalent to arctan(37/28), which places it in the first quadrant. However, for complex numbers of the form (a+bi)z + (c+di)/z where |z| is constant, we often use the form z = re^(i\u03b8) and consider the periodicity of the complex exponential function. Since we are dealing with |z| = 4, we have z = 4e^(i\u03b8). The periodicity of the exponential function means that \u03b8 can be adjusted by adding multiples of 2\u03c0 to remain in the same orientation. We need to finalize \u03b8 based on the quadrant information and periodicity, and ensure it is consistent with the conditions given. Since \u03b8 is in the first quadrant, and arctan(37/28) is already in the first quadrant, we do not need to adjust it by adding \u03c0 or 2\u03c0. Therefore, \u03b8 = arctan(37/28) is the finalized angle.; answer - \u03b8 = arctan(37/28)"

The unit complex number can be represented as e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the angle in radians. Therefore, we can express z as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. This is a standard way to represent complex numbers with a given magnitude.; answer: z = 4e^{i\u03b8}\nCoT agent fxBM, on substituting and simplifying, thinking: We have z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, so substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. We get (75+117i)(4e^{i\u03b8}) + (96+144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}). Simplifying, this becomes (300e^{i\u03b8} + 468ie^{i\u03b8}) + (24e^{-i\u03b8} + 36ie^{-i\u03b8}). Now, we need to express this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Use Euler's formula: e^{i\u03b8} = cos(\u03b8) + i sin(\u03b8) and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos(\u03b8) - i sin(\u03b8). Substitute these into the expression and simplify to find the real part as a function of \u03b8.; answer: The real part of the expression is 300cos(\u03b8) + 36cos(\u03b8) - 468sin(\u03b8) + 24sin(\u03b8), which simplifies to 336cos(\u03b8) - 444sin(\u03b8).\nCoT agent 8PvE, on calculating \u03c6, thinking: We have the expression for the real part as 336cos(\u03b8) - 444sin(\u03b8). To find the maximum value, we can express it in the form Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude and \u03c6 is a phase shift. The amplitude R is given by R = \u221a(336^2 + 444^2), and tan(\u03c6) = -444/336. However, the sub-task 3a asks for \u03c6 using tan(\u03c6) = -432/324, which seems to be a typo or mistake, as it doesn't match the coefficients in the expression we found. Therefore, I will calculate \u03c6 using the correct coefficients: tan(\u03c6) = -444/336.; answer: tan(\u03c6) = -444/336 = -37/28\n\u03c6 = arctan(-37/28)\nCoT agent ab0o, on exploring the relationship between \u03c6 and \u03b8, thinking: To maximize the real part of the expression 336cos(\u03b8) - 444sin(\u03b8), we should express it as Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude and \u03c6 is the phase shift. The amplitude R is calculated as R = \u221a(336^2 + 444^2). The phase shift \u03c6 is calculated using tan(\u03c6) = -444/336, which gives \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28). To maximize the expression Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), we need to set \u03b8 + \u03c6 = 0, which means \u03b8 = -\u03c6. This is the condition to maximize the real part of the expression.; answer: The relationship between \u03c6 and \u03b8 to maximize the real part is \u03b8 = -\u03c6.\nCoT agent q9uA, on calculating the adjustment needed for \u03b8, thinking: From sub-task 3b1a, we determined that to maximize the real part of the expression, we need to set \u03b8 = -\u03c6, where \u03c6 is the phase shift given by \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28). The adjustment needed for \u03b8 is to change it to -\u03c6. Therefore, the adjustment needed for \u03b8 is simply to set \u03b8 to -\u03c6, which is the negative of the calculated phase shift \u03c6.; answer: Set \u03b8 to -arctan(-37/28) to maximize the real part.\nCoT agent QEJl, on determining the quadrant for \u03b8, thinking: We have \u03b8 = -arctan(-37/28). The expression -arctan(-37/28) is equivalent to arctan(37/28), since -arctan(-x) = arctan(x). The angle arctan(37/28) is in the first quadrant because both 37 and 28 are positive, meaning the angle is between 0 and \u03c0/2.; answer: First quadrant.\nCoT agent yWrx, on finalizing \u03b8 based on quadrant and periodicity, thinking: We have determined that \u03b8 = -arctan(-37/28) is equivalent to arctan(37/28), which places it in the first quadrant. However, for complex numbers of the form (a+bi)z + (c+di)/z where |z| is constant, we often use the form z = re^(i\u03b8) and consider the periodicity of the complex exponential function. Since we are dealing with |z| = 4, we have z = 4e^(i\u03b8). The periodicity of the exponential function means that \u03b8 can be adjusted by adding multiples of 2\u03c0 to remain in the same orientation. We need to finalize \u03b8 based on the quadrant information and periodicity, and ensure it is consistent with the conditions given. Since \u03b8 is in the first quadrant, and arctan(37/28) is already in the first quadrant, we do not need to adjust it by adding \u03c0 or 2\u03c0. Therefore, \u03b8 = arctan(37/28) is the finalized angle.; answer: \u03b8 = arctan(37/28)"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer?

Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer?

Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.

Since the magnitude of z is 4, we can write z as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the angle in radians that z makes with the positive real axis. This is a standard way to express a complex number with a given magnitude.; answer - z = 4e^{i\u03b8}\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have the complex number z in polar form as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. We need to substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + \\frac{96+144i}{z} and simplify to find the real part as a function of \u03b8. First, substitute z = 4e^{i\u03b8} into the expression: (75+117i)(4e^{i\u03b8}) + \\frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\u03b8}}. This simplifies to (300e^{i\u03b8} + 468ie^{i\u03b8}) + \\frac{24+36i}{e^{i\u03b8}}. The second term can be written as (24+36i)e^{-i\u03b8}. Now, express each term in terms of real and imaginary parts using Euler's formula: e^{i\u03b8} = cos(\u03b8) + i sin(\u03b8) and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos(\u03b8) - i sin(\u03b8). For the first term: 300e^{i\u03b8} + 468ie^{i\u03b8} = 300(cos(\u03b8) + i sin(\u03b8)) + 468i(cos(\u03b8) + i sin(\u03b8)) = (300 cos(\u03b8) - 468 sin(\u03b8)) + i(300 sin(\u03b8) + 468 cos(\u03b8)). For the second term: (24+36i)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24+36i)(cos(\u03b8) - i sin(\u03b8)) = (24 cos(\u03b8) + 36 sin(\u03b8)) + i(36 cos(\u03b8) - 24 sin(\u03b8)). Combine the real parts: 300 cos(\u03b8) - 468 sin(\u03b8) + 24 cos(\u03b8) + 36 sin(\u03b8) = (300 + 24) cos(\u03b8) + (36 - 468) sin(\u03b8) = 324 cos(\u03b8) - 432 sin(\u03b8). This is the real part as a function of \u03b8.; answer - 324 cos(\u03b8) - 432 sin(\u03b8)\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - To find \u03c6, we need to solve the equation tan(\u03c6) = -444/336. This involves finding the angle \u03c6 whose tangent is -444/336. Simplifying -444/336 gives -37/28. We can calculate \u03c6 using the arctangent function: \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28). This will give us the angle \u03c6 in radians.; answer - arctan(-37/28)\nSub-task 3b1a output: thinking - To maximize the real part of the expression (75+117i)z+(96+144i)/z where |z|=4, we need to consider the relationship between the angles \u03c6 and \u03b8. From sub-task 3a, we have \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28). If z = re^{i\u03b8}, then the expression becomes a function of \u03b8, and we need to find the value of \u03b8 that maximizes the real part. The real part will depend on the cosine of the difference between \u03c6 and \u03b8. The maximum real part is achieved when cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = 1, which implies \u03b8 = \u03c6 + 2k\u03c0 for some integer k.; answer - The real part is maximized when \u03b8 = \u03c6 + 2k\u03c0, where \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28).\nSub-task 3b1b output: thinking - To maximize the real part of the expression, we need \u03b8 to be aligned such that cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6) = 1. This occurs when \u03b8 = \u03c6 + 2k\u03c0 for some integer k. Since \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28), the adjustment needed for \u03b8 is simply to set it equal to \u03c6 modulo 2\u03c0. Therefore, \u03b8 should be adjusted to \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28), ensuring that \u03b8 = \u03c6 + 2k\u03c0.; answer - Set \u03b8 to \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28) to maximize the real part.\nSub-task 3b2a output: thinking - The angle \u03b8 is set to \u03c6 = arctan(-37/28) based on the maximization condition.

Given z = 4(cos \u03b8 + i sin \u03b8), the expression for the real part becomes a function of \u03b8. We need to differentiate this with respect to \u03b8.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

A complex number z with modulus 4 can be written as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of the complex number. This representation satisfies the condition |z|=4, as the modulus of 4e^{i\u03b8} is 4.; answer - z = 4e^{i\u03b8}\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We are given that z = 4e^{i\u03b8} and need to substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. Substituting z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, we have z = 4(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8). The expression becomes (75 + 117i)(4(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8)) + (96 + 144i)/(4(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8)). We simplify each term separately. For the first term, (75 + 117i)(4(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8)) = 300cos\u03b8 + 300isin\u03b8 + 468icos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8. This simplifies to (300cos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8) + i(300sin\u03b8 + 468cos\u03b8). For the second term, (96 + 144i)/(4(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8)) can be simplified by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: (96 + 144i)(4(cos\u03b8) - 4isin\u03b8) / (16(cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8)) = (96(4cos\u03b8) + 144(4isin\u03b8) - 96(4isin\u03b8) + 144(4cos\u03b8)) / 16 = (384cos\u03b8 + 576cos\u03b8 + i(576sin\u03b8 - 384sin\u03b8)) / 16 = (960cos\u03b8 + i192sin\u03b8) / 16 = 60cos\u03b8 + i12sin\u03b8. The real part of the entire expression is then (300cos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8) + 60cos\u03b8 = 360cos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8.; answer - 360cos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8\nSub-task 3a output: thinking - We have the expression 360cos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8, which can be represented in the form Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) by using the identity Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = R(cos\u03b8cos\u03c6 - sin\u03b8sin\u03c6). To find \u03c6, we use tan(\u03c6) = sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6 = -468/360. Simplifying this gives tan(\u03c6) = -13/10. We can calculate \u03c6 using the arctangent function: \u03c6 = arctan(-13/10).; answer - \u03c6 = arctan(-13/10)\nSub-task 3b1a output: thinking - We are given that the expression can be written as Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) with R = 360 and tan(\u03c6) = -13/10. To maximize the real part, we need to maximize Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6). The maximum value of cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) is 1, which occurs when \u03b8 + \u03c6 = 0. Therefore, to maximize the real part, we should set \u03b8 = -\u03c6.; answer - Set \u03b8 = -arctan(-13/10) to maximize the real part.\nSub-task 3b1b output: thinking - To maximize the real part of the expression, we need to set \u03b8 = -\u03c6, where \u03c6 is determined by tan(\u03c6) = -13/10. Therefore, \u03b8 should be set to -arctan(-13/10). This adjustment aligns \u03b8 with the angle that maximizes the real part of the expression.; answer - Set \u03b8 = -arctan(-13/10).\nSub-task 3b2a output: thinking - We need to determine the quadrant of \u03b8 = -arctan(-13/10). The arctan function returns angles in the range (-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), corresponding to quadrants I and IV. Since the argument of arctan is negative, -arctan(-13/10) will be positive, placing \u03b8 in quadrant I.; answer - Quadrant I\nSub-task 3b2b1 output: thinking - We need to re-evaluate the expression for the real part of (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, where z = 4e^{i\u03b8} and \u03b8 is in quadrant I. The expression simplifies using the properties of complex conjugates and Euler's formula. Since \u03b8 is in quadrant I, cos(\u03b8) > 0 and sin(\u03b8) > 0, which affects the real part calculation.; answer - The real part of the expression is 300cos(\u03b8) - 18sin(\u03b8).\nSub-task 3b2b2 output: thinking - To find the derivative of the real part 300cos(\u03b8) - 18sin(\u03b8) with respect to \u03b8, we apply standard differentiation rules for trigonometric functions. The derivative of cos(\u03b8) is -sin(\u03b8) and the derivative of sin(\u03b8) is cos(\u03b8).; answer - -300sin(\u03b8) - 18cos(\u03b8)\nSub-task 3b2b3 output: thinking - To find the critical points, we need to set the derivative of the real part with respect to \u03b8 to zero. The derivative is -300sin(\u03b8) - 18cos(\u03b8). Setting this equal to zero gives us the equation -300sin(\u03b8) - 18cos(\u03b8) = 0. This can be rewritten as 300sin(\u03b8) = -18cos(\u03b8), or sin(\u03b8)/cos(\u03b8) = -18/300, which simplifies to tan(\u03b8) = -3/50. Solving for \u03b8 gives \u03b8 = arctan(-3/50).; answer - \u03b8 = arctan(-3/50)"

This representation satisfies the condition |z|=4, as the modulus of 4e^{i\u03b8} is 4.; answer: z = 4e^{i\u03b8}\nCoT agent J4Al, on substituting and simplifying, thinking: We are given that z = 4e^{i\u03b8} and need to substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. Substituting z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, we have z = 4(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8). The expression becomes (75 + 117i)(4(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8)) + (96 + 144i)/(4(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8)). We simplify each term separately. For the first term, (75 + 117i)(4(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8)) = 300cos\u03b8 + 300isin\u03b8 + 468icos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8. This simplifies to (300cos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8) + i(300sin\u03b8 + 468cos\u03b8). For the second term, (96 + 144i)/(4(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8)) can be simplified by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: (96 + 144i)(4(cos\u03b8) - 4isin\u03b8) / (16(cos^2\u03b8 + sin^2\u03b8)) = (96(4cos\u03b8) + 144(4isin\u03b8) - 96(4isin\u03b8) + 144(4cos\u03b8)) / 16 = (384cos\u03b8 + 576cos\u03b8 + i(576sin\u03b8 - 384sin\u03b8)) / 16 = (960cos\u03b8 + i192sin\u03b8) / 16 = 60cos\u03b8 + i12sin\u03b8. The real part of the entire expression is then (300cos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8) + 60cos\u03b8 = 360cos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8.; answer: 360cos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8\nCoT agent EGpu, on calculating \u03c6, thinking: We have the expression 360cos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8, which can be represented in the form Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) by using the identity Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = R(cos\u03b8cos\u03c6 - sin\u03b8sin\u03c6). To find \u03c6, we use tan(\u03c6) = sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6 = -468/360. Simplifying this gives tan(\u03c6) = -13/10. We can calculate \u03c6 using the arctangent function: \u03c6 = arctan(-13/10).; answer: \u03c6 = arctan(-13/10)\nCoT agent RmRK, on exploring the relationship between \u03c6 and \u03b8, thinking: We are given that the expression can be written as Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) with R = 360 and tan(\u03c6) = -13/10. To maximize the real part, we need to maximize Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6). The maximum value of cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) is 1, which occurs when \u03b8 + \u03c6 = 0. Therefore, to maximize the real part, we should set \u03b8 = -\u03c6.; answer: Set \u03b8 = -arctan(-13/10) to maximize the real part.\nCoT agent hf6F, on calculating the adjustment needed for \u03b8, thinking: To maximize the real part of the expression, we need to set \u03b8 = -\u03c6, where \u03c6 is determined by tan(\u03c6) = -13/10. Therefore, \u03b8 should be set to -arctan(-13/10). This adjustment aligns \u03b8 with the angle that maximizes the real part of the expression.; answer: Set \u03b8 = -arctan(-13/10).\nCoT agent hYR2, on determining the quadrant for \u03b8, thinking: We need to determine the quadrant of \u03b8 = -arctan(-13/10). The arctan function returns angles in the range (-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), corresponding to quadrants I and IV. Since the argument of arctan is negative, -arctan(-13/10) will be positive, placing \u03b8 in quadrant I.; answer: Quadrant I\nCoT agent As9b, on re-evaluating the expression for the real part, thinking: We need to re-evaluate the expression for the real part of (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z, where z = 4e^{i\u03b8} and \u03b8 is in quadrant I. The expression simplifies using the properties of complex conjugates and Euler's formula. Since \u03b8 is in quadrant I, cos(\u03b8) > 0 and sin(\u03b8) > 0, which affects the real part calculation.; answer: The real part of the expression is 300cos(\u03b8) - 18sin(\u03b8).\nCoT agent gHmg, on calculating the derivative of the real part, thinking: To find the derivative of the real part 300cos(\u03b8) - 18sin(\u03b8) with respect to \u03b8, we apply standard differentiation rules for trigonometric functions. The derivative of cos(\u03b8) is -sin(\u03b8) and the derivative of sin(\u03b8) is cos(\u03b8).; answer: -300sin(\u03b8) - 18cos(\u03b8)\nCoT agent hNwj, on solving for critical points to determine \u03b8, thinking: To find the critical points, we need to set the derivative of the real part with respect to \u03b8 to zero. The derivative is -300sin(\u03b8) - 18cos(\u03b8). Setting this equal to zero gives us the equation -300sin(\u03b8) - 18cos(\u03b8) = 0. This can be rewritten as 300sin(\u03b8) = -18cos(\u03b8), or sin(\u03b8)/cos(\u03b8) = -18/300, which simplifies to tan(\u03b8) = -3/50. Solving for \u03b8 gives \u03b8 = arctan(-3/50).; answer: \u03b8 = arctan(-3/50)"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

The problem is complex, and without detailed calculations, it's challenging to verify critical points accurately. The previous incorrect answers suggest a need for careful trigonometric analysis and possibly numerical methods.\n\nAnswer:<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Carefully compute the derivative of the real part with respect to \u03b8, set it to zero, and solve for \u03b8 to find the critical points. Consider using numerical methods or software for solving trigonometric equations if necessary."

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

A complex number z with modulus 4 can be written as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. This is because for any complex number z = re^{i\u03b8}, the modulus |z| is r, and here we have |z|=4, so r=4.; answer - z = 4e^{i\u03b8}\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We have z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, so we substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z.

Substitute these into the expression and simplify to find the real part as a function of \u03b8.; answer - Substitute z = 4e^{i\u03b8} into the expression: (75+117i)(4e^{i\u03b8}) + (96+144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}).\n\nThis becomes: (75+117i)(4(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)) + (96+144i)(1/4)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8).\n\nSimplify each part:\n\nPart 1: (75+117i)(4(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)) = 4(75cos\u03b8 - 117sin\u03b8 + i(75sin\u03b8 + 117cos\u03b8)).\n\nPart 2: (96+144i)(1/4)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = (24cos\u03b8 + 36sin\u03b8 + i(-24sin\u03b8 + 36cos\u03b8)).\n\nCombine the real parts: 4(75cos\u03b8 - 117sin\u03b8) + 24cos\u03b8 + 36sin\u03b8.\n\nThe real part is: 300cos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8 + 24cos\u03b8 + 36sin\u03b8 = (300 + 24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36)sin\u03b8 = 324cos\u03b8 - 432sin\u03b8.\n\nReal part as a function of \u03b8: 324cos\u03b8 - 432sin\u03b8.\nSub-task 3a1a output: thinking - We have the expression for the real part as 324cos\u03b8 - 432sin\u03b8. To maximize this, we can express it in the form Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6). We use the identity Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = R(cos\u03b8cos\u03c6 - sin\u03b8sin\u03c6) and match it to 324cos\u03b8 - 432sin\u03b8. We find R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) and tan(\u03c6) = -432/324 = -4/3. We need to verify tan(\u03c6) = -4/3 and calculate \u03c6 accordingly.; answer - tan(\u03c6) = -4/3. \u03c6 = arctan(-4/3) = -53.13 degrees or -0.927 radians.\nSub-task 3a1b output: thinking - We have \u03c6 = arctan(-4/3). We can use trigonometric identities to express \u03c6 in a simplified form. Since arctan(-4/3) is the angle whose tangent is -4/3, we can express this angle in terms of sine and cosine. We know that for an angle \u03c6, tan(\u03c6) = sin(\u03c6)/cos(\u03c6). Therefore, if tan(\u03c6) = -4/3, we can set sin(\u03c6) = -4k and cos(\u03c6) = 3k for some k such that (sin(\u03c6))^2 + (cos(\u03c6))^2 = 1. Solving this gives k = 1/5, so sin(\u03c6) = -4/5 and cos(\u03c6) = 3/5. Thus, \u03c6 can be simplified using these values.; answer - sin(\u03c6) = -4/5, cos(\u03c6) = 3/5\nSub-task 3b2b3b1 output: thinking - To analyze the derivative of the real part with respect to \u03b8, we need to express the real part of the given expression in terms of \u03b8.

The derivative of the real part with respect to \u03b8 will involve differentiating this expression. However, without explicit simplification of the expression in terms of \u03b8, analyzing the derivative is too complex.; answer - <TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Simplify the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z in terms of \u03b8 first, then compute the derivative of the real part with respect to \u03b8.\nSub-task 3b2b3b2 output: thinking - The task requires finding critical points for the real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z where |z| = 4, expressed in terms of \u03b8. To do this, we need to express the real part in terms of \u03b8, differentiate it with respect to \u03b8, and find where the derivative is zero.

A complex number z with modulus 4 can be written as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. This is because for any complex number z = re^{i\u03b8}, the modulus |z| is r, and here we have |z|=4, so r=4.; answer: z = 4e^{i\u03b8}\nCoT agent zTaS, on substituting and simplifying, thinking: We have z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, so we substitute this into the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. We have z = 4(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) and 1/z = 1/4(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). Substitute these into the expression and simplify to find the real part as a function of \u03b8.; answer: Substitute z = 4e^{i\u03b8} into the expression: (75+117i)(4e^{i\u03b8}) + (96+144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}).\n\nThis becomes: (75+117i)(4(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)) + (96+144i)(1/4)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8).\n\nSimplify each part:\n\nPart 1: (75+117i)(4(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)) = 4(75cos\u03b8 - 117sin\u03b8 + i(75sin\u03b8 + 117cos\u03b8)).\n\nPart 2: (96+144i)(1/4)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = (24cos\u03b8 + 36sin\u03b8 + i(-24sin\u03b8 + 36cos\u03b8)).\n\nCombine the real parts: 4(75cos\u03b8 - 117sin\u03b8) + 24cos\u03b8 + 36sin\u03b8.\n\nThe real part is: 300cos\u03b8 - 468sin\u03b8 + 24cos\u03b8 + 36sin\u03b8 = (300 + 24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 + 36)sin\u03b8 = 324cos\u03b8 - 432sin\u03b8.\n\nReal part as a function of \u03b8: 324cos\u03b8 - 432sin\u03b8.\nCoT agent oXjS, on verifying \u03c6, thinking: We have the expression for the real part as 324cos\u03b8 - 432sin\u03b8. To maximize this, we can express it in the form Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6). We use the identity Rcos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = R(cos\u03b8cos\u03c6 - sin\u03b8sin\u03c6) and match it to 324cos\u03b8 - 432sin\u03b8. We find R = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) and tan(\u03c6) = -432/324 = -4/3. We need to verify tan(\u03c6) = -4/3 and calculate \u03c6 accordingly.; answer: tan(\u03c6) = -4/3. \u03c6 = arctan(-4/3) = -53.13 degrees or -0.927 radians.\nCoT agent 24ug, on simplifying \u03c6, thinking: We have \u03c6 = arctan(-4/3). We can use trigonometric identities to express \u03c6 in a simplified form. Since arctan(-4/3) is the angle whose tangent is -4/3, we can express this angle in terms of sine and cosine. We know that for an angle \u03c6, tan(\u03c6) = sin(\u03c6)/cos(\u03c6). Therefore, if tan(\u03c6) = -4/3, we can set sin(\u03c6) = -4k and cos(\u03c6) = 3k for some k such that (sin(\u03c6))^2 + (cos(\u03c6))^2 = 1. Solving this gives k = 1/5, so sin(\u03c6) = -4/5 and cos(\u03c6) = 3/5. Thus, \u03c6 can be simplified using these values.; answer: sin(\u03c6) = -4/5, cos(\u03c6) = 3/5\nCoT agent Qgy4, on analyzing derivative, thinking: To analyze the derivative of the real part with respect to \u03b8, we need to express the real part of the given expression in terms of \u03b8. We have z = 4(cos(\u03b8) + i sin(\u03b8)) since |z| = 4. The expression is (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. To find the real part, we substitute z = 4e^(i\u03b8) and simplify. The derivative of the real part with respect to \u03b8 will involve differentiating this expression. However, without explicit simplification of the expression in terms of \u03b8, analyzing the derivative is too complex.; answer: <TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Simplify the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z in terms of \u03b8 first, then compute the derivative of the real part with respect to \u03b8.\nCoT agent xqUO, on solving for critical points, thinking: The task requires finding critical points for the real part of the expression (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z where |z| = 4, expressed in terms of \u03b8.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"
