        "Solvable": "The sub-tasks are still too complex for the blocks, as indicated by the '<TOO_HARD>' outputs. The suggestions to use coordinate geometry or computational tools highlight the need for further decomposition. The repeated incorrect answers of '0' and '300' suggest that the architecture and decomposition are not effectively guiding the agents to the correct solution. This indicates a decomposition issue (a) where the tasks are still too complex.",
        "Completeness": "The sub-tasks do not fully cover the necessary geometric reasoning to ensure that selected pairs form closed rectangles with right angles. The instructions lack specificity in guiding the agents to verify geometric constraints, which is crucial for solving the problem effectively.",
        "Fitness": "The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The repeated incorrect answers of '0' and '300' suggest that the architecture and decomposition are not effectively guiding the agents to the correct solution. An updated decomposition is needed to ensure the final response is improved and avoids previously incorrect answers."

New sub-task 6: Based on the output of sub-task 5, count the number of valid rectangles by ensuring that the selected pairs form closed shapes. This further decomposition breaks down the task of identifying perpendicular pairs into calculating angles, making it more specific and manageable for the existing blocks.",
