    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The diagram below shows three of those rectangles.
[asy] unitsize(0.6 inch); for(int i=0; i&lt;360; i+=30) { dot(dir(i), 4+black); draw(dir(i)--dir(i+30)); } draw(dir(120)--dir(330)); filldraw(dir(210)--dir(240)--dir(30)--dir(60)--cycle, mediumgray, linewidth(1.5)); draw((0,0.366)--(0.366,0), linewidth(1.5)); [/asy]

    <pre>thought: 
    **Decomposition:**
    To solve the problem of finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to break down the problem into manageable sub-tasks that can be handled by the existing LLM architectures. Here is the decomposition:
    
    1. **Sub-task 1:** Identify the vertices of the dodecagon and the possible diagonals. This is essential because rectangles can be formed by selecting two pairs of parallel sides or diagonals.
    
    2. **Sub-task 2:** Based on the output of sub-task 1, calculate the possible pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) that can form rectangles. This involves combinatorial reasoning to select pairs of parallel lines.
    
    3. **Sub-task 3:** Based on the output of sub-task 2, count the number of rectangles formed. This involves ensuring the selected lines form a closed rectangle shape.
    
    **Overall Architecture:**
    To address each sub-task, we will utilize the existing blocks in the archive:
    
    - **Sub-task 1** will be addressed using the **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** block to identify and list the vertices and diagonals of the dodecagon.
    
    - **Sub-task 2** will be handled by the **Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SC)** block to explore different combinations of parallel lines and ensure varied reasoning paths for selecting these pairs.
    
    - **Sub-task 3** will be addressed using the **LLM Debate** block to ensure that the selected combinations indeed form a rectangle, leveraging diverse perspectives and final decision-making.
    
    **Implementation:**
    - **Layer 1:** Use the CoT block to address sub-task 1, identifying vertices and diagonals.
    - **Layer 2:** Use the CoT-SC block to address sub-task 2, calculating possible pairs of parallel lines.
    - **Layer 3:** Use the LLM Debate block to address sub-task 3, counting the number of rectangles and confirming the shape.
    
    This multi-layered approach ensures that each sub-task is handled by a specialized block, maximizing the potential for correct reasoning and solution generation.

In a regular dodecagon, there are 6 pairs of parallel sides. Additionally, we can form rectangles using diagonals that are parallel. Each vertex connects to 6 other vertices via diagonals, and among these diagonals, pairs that are separated by the same number of vertices are parallel. For example, diagonals (1, 4) and (7, 10) are parallel. We need to count all such pairs of parallel sides and diagonals that can form rectangles.; answer: 66\nCoT-SC agent jHFA, on calculating pairs, thinking: To form a rectangle inside a regular dodecagon, we need two pairs of parallel lines. In a regular dodecagon, there are 12 sides and 30 diagonals. Each side is parallel to the side opposite to it, and each diagonal is parallel to another diagonal. We need to count the number of ways to form two pairs of parallel lines. There are 6 pairs of parallel sides. For diagonals, we can group them based on the number of vertices they skip. Diagonals that skip the same number of vertices are parallel. For example, diagonals (1, 4) and (7, 10) are parallel. By considering all possible diagonals and sides, we can calculate the number of rectangles.; answer: 66\nCoT-SC agent ZQyN, on calculating pairs, thinking: To form a rectangle inside a regular dodecagon, we need two pairs of parallel lines. These lines can be either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. Each side of the dodecagon is parallel to the side opposite it. A regular dodecagon has 12 sides, so there are 6 pairs of parallel sides. Additionally, diagonals that are equally spaced will also be parallel. For example, diagonals that skip the same number of vertices will be parallel. A rectangle can be formed by choosing two pairs of such parallel lines. We need to count all such combinations.; answer: 66\nCoT-SC agent 7FHH, on calculating pairs, thinking: To form a rectangle inside a regular dodecagon, we need to choose two pairs of parallel lines. These lines can be either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. Each side of the dodecagon is parallel to the side that is directly opposite to it. There are 6 pairs of such parallel sides. Additionally, the diagonals of the dodecagon can also form parallel pairs. In a regular dodecagon, each diagonal connects two vertices that are equidistant from each other. For each vertex, there are 5 diagonals, and these diagonals can be grouped into parallel pairs. There are 6 groups of parallel diagonals, corresponding to the 6 different lengths of diagonals possible in a dodecagon.

To form a rectangle, each pair of parallel lines must intersect with another pair of parallel lines at right angles. In a regular dodecagon, each vertex is connected by lines that can form right angles with other lines. Given the symmetry and structure of the dodecagon, each pair of parallel lines can form a rectangle with another pair of parallel lines. Since there are 66 pairs, and each pair can potentially combine with another to form a rectangle, the number of rectangles is the same as the number of pairs of parallel lines.; answer: 66\nDebate agent XX4n, round 0, on counting rectangles, thinking: Based on the output of sub-task 2, there are 66 pairs of parallel lines. To form a rectangle, two pairs of parallel lines are needed, one for each pair of opposite sides. Each rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of parallel lines from the 66 identified pairs. However, not every combination will form a rectangle because the lines must intersect at the vertices of the dodecagon. Calculating the exact number of valid rectangles requires ensuring that the selected pairs form a closed rectangle shape, which is a complex combinatorial problem involving the arrangement and intersection of lines.; answer: 300\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Further decomposition could involve analyzing specific configurations of line intersections and counting valid rectangles for each configuration.\nDebate agent XWSU, round 1, on counting rectangles, thinking: To determine the number of rectangles formed inside a regular dodecagon, we need to identify pairs of parallel lines that can serve as the opposite sides of the rectangles. The dodecagon has 12 sides and numerous diagonals, and each pair of parallel lines can potentially form a rectangle. However, not all combinations of these pairs will form valid rectangles, as the sides must intersect at the vertices of the dodecagon. Calculating the exact number involves complex combinatorial analysis of line arrangements and intersections. Given the conflicting answers and complexity, it appears additional analysis or decomposition is needed to accurately count the rectangles.; answer: 300\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Further decomposition could involve analyzing specific configurations of line intersections and counting valid rectangles for each configuration.\nDebate agent XX4n, round 1, on counting rectangles, thinking: The problem involves determining how many rectangles can be formed using pairs of parallel lines in a regular dodecagon. Each rectangle requires two pairs of parallel lines that intersect at right angles at the vertices of the dodecagon. Despite the initial indication of 66 pairs of parallel lines, forming rectangles requires careful consideration of the geometry and intersection points.

The challenge lies in ensuring that the selected pairs of parallel lines form closed rectangles, which requires complex combinatorial geometry to account for all possible configurations and intersections.

Each rectangle requires two pairs of parallel lines intersecting at right angles, which complicates the counting due to the need to ensure closed rectangle shapes.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

Additionally, the answer of &#39;300&#39; appears in the final response and is marked as incorrect in the memory, suggesting that the current decomposition does not lead to a correct solution.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. If we label them as A1, A2, ..., A12 in clockwise order, each vertex is connected to 11 other vertices. The diagonals are the connections between non-adjacent vertices. For each vertex, there are 9 diagonals (since we exclude the vertex itself and its two adjacent vertices from the connections). Since there are 12 vertices, we initially count 12 * 9 diagonals, but this counts each diagonal twice, so we divide by 2. Therefore, there are 54 diagonals in a regular dodecagon.; answer - There are 54 diagonals in a regular dodecagon.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To find the number of pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) in a regular dodecagon, we need to consider both sides and diagonals. In a regular dodecagon, opposite sides are parallel, and there are 6 pairs of such parallel sides. For diagonals, a diagonal connecting vertex i to vertex j is parallel to a diagonal connecting vertex i+k to vertex j+k, where k is a multiple of 3, due to the symmetry of the dodecagon. We need to count these pairs systematically, considering the rotational symmetry of the dodecagon.; answer - There are 30 pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) in a regular dodecagon.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - A rectangle is formed by two pairs of parallel lines. In a regular dodecagon, each side has a parallel opposite side, and similarly, diagonals can be paired based on their symmetry. From sub-task 2, we know there are 30 pairs of parallel lines. To form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular to each other. In a regular dodecagon, there are 6 sets of parallel sides, and for each set, there is one perpendicular set due to the 120-degree internal angle. For diagonals, each diagonal can be paired with another diagonal to form a right angle, considering the rotational symmetry. Thus, we need to systematically verify which of these pairs can form rectangles with right angles.; answer - 30\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The problem involves counting rectangles formed by sides and diagonals of a regular dodecagon. The challenge is ensuring the pairs form closed rectangles with right angles. Previous answers suggest 30 rectangles, but without a systematic method or additional geometric analysis, this count remains uncertain. The problem&#39;s complexity stems from the need for precise geometric reasoning and verification of all potential combinations.; answer - 30\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide a systematic approach or additional information about specific pairs of sides and diagonals that form perpendicular pairs in the dodecagon to accurately count the valid rectangles.&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent neCn, on identifying vertices and diagonals, thinking: A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. If we label them as A1, A2, ..., A12 in clockwise order, each vertex is connected to 11 other vertices. The diagonals are the connections between non-adjacent vertices. For each vertex, there are 9 diagonals (since we exclude the vertex itself and its two adjacent vertices from the connections). Since there are 12 vertices, we initially count 12 * 9 diagonals, but this counts each diagonal twice, so we divide by 2. Therefore, there are 54 diagonals in a regular dodecagon.; answer: There are 54 diagonals in a regular dodecagon.\nCoT-SC agent F66c, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To find the number of pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) in a regular dodecagon, we need to consider both sides and diagonals. In a regular dodecagon, opposite sides are parallel, and there are 6 pairs of such parallel sides. For diagonals, a diagonal connecting vertex i to vertex j is parallel to a diagonal connecting vertex i+k to vertex j+k, where k is a multiple of 3, due to the symmetry of the dodecagon. We need to count these pairs systematically, considering the rotational symmetry of the dodecagon.; answer: There are 30 pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) in a regular dodecagon.\nCoT-SC agent 5Gbv, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To form a rectangle inside the dodecagon, we need two pairs of parallel lines. In a regular dodecagon, each side is parallel to one other side, and each diagonal can be paired with another diagonal that is parallel to it. The dodecagon has 12 sides, forming 6 pairs of parallel sides. There are 54 diagonals, and each diagonal has a parallel diagonal, forming 27 pairs of parallel diagonals. We need to consider all possible combinations of choosing two pairs of parallel lines from these pairs to form rectangles. For sides, we can choose 2 pairs out of 6, and for diagonals, we can choose 2 pairs out of 27. Additionally, we can mix one pair of sides with one pair of diagonals. However, the enumeration of all possible pairs of parallel lines is complex due to the large number of diagonal pairs and the potential for mixing sides and diagonals.; answer: The pairs of parallel lines can be formed as follows: 6 pairs of parallel sides, 27 pairs of parallel diagonals, and combinations of these for forming rectangles. Enumerating all pairs is complex due to the number of diagonal pairs and combinations.\nCoT-SC agent SVN5, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To find the number of pairs of parallel lines in a regular dodecagon, we need to consider both the sides and the diagonals. In a regular dodecagon, opposite sides are parallel. Since there are 12 sides, we can form 6 pairs of parallel sides. For the diagonals, we note that diagonals are parallel if they are equidistant from the center and span the same number of vertices. For each pair of opposite vertices, there is a diagonal, and diagonals that are rotationally symmetric around the center are parallel. By considering the symmetry and the number of vertices spanned, we can enumerate the parallel diagonals. This is a complex combinatorial problem that involves considering the geometry and symmetry of the dodecagon.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider the rotational symmetry and the number of vertices spanned by diagonals to find parallel diagonals. This involves geometric reasoning about the dodecagon&#39;s structure.\nCoT-SC agent sPg8, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To find the number of pairs of parallel lines in a regular dodecagon, we need to consider both the sides and the diagonals. The dodecagon has 12 sides, and opposite sides are parallel, forming 6 pairs of parallel sides. For diagonals, we need to consider diagonals that are parallel to each other. Diagonals that are parallel will have the same angular orientation. Since the dodecagon is regular, diagonals connecting vertices that are symmetrically opposite will be parallel. We need to systematically count these pairs of parallel diagonals.; answer: There are 6 pairs of parallel sides and additional pairs of parallel diagonals. However, enumerating all pairs of parallel diagonals is complex due to the symmetrical nature of the dodecagon.\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Enumerate diagonals by considering diagonals of the same length and direction, and count pairs based on symmetry.\nCoT-SC agent 7Zu8, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To enumerate all possible pairs of parallel lines in a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the rotational symmetry of the dodecagon. Each side of the dodecagon is parallel to another side that is opposite it, as the dodecagon can be divided into 6 pairs of opposite sides. For diagonals, we need to consider diagonals that are parallel by being evenly spaced around the center. Since each vertex connects to 9 other vertices via diagonals, and diagonals are parallel if they maintain the same angle of separation, we can find parallel diagonals by considering the rotational symmetry and spacing. However, explicitly listing all these pairs is complex due to the number of combinations and requires careful geometric reasoning. This makes it difficult to enumerate without visual aids or further decomposition.; answer: 12\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Decompose the problem by first identifying pairs of parallel sides, then separately identifying pairs of parallel diagonals, considering the rotational symmetry and spacing of the vertices.\nCoT agent 3MpJ, on verifying pairs, thinking: A rectangle is formed by two pairs of parallel lines. In a regular dodecagon, each side has a parallel opposite side, and similarly, diagonals can be paired based on their symmetry. From sub-task 2, we know there are 30 pairs of parallel lines. To form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular to each other. In a regular dodecagon, there are 6 sets of parallel sides, and for each set, there is one perpendicular set due to the 120-degree internal angle. For diagonals, each diagonal can be paired with another diagonal to form a right angle, considering the rotational symmetry. Thus, we need to systematically verify which of these pairs can form rectangles with right angles.; answer: 30\nDebate agent TgtA, round 0, on counting rectangles, thinking: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid rectangles that can be formed using sides or diagonals of a regular dodecagon. From the previous sub-task, we know there are 30 pairs of parallel lines in a dodecagon. For each pair of parallel lines, there must be a perpendicular pair to form a rectangle. The dodecagon has 6 sets of parallel sides, each with a perpendicular set due to its internal angles. Additionally, diagonals can also form rectangles. We need to count all combinations of two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular to each other and form closed rectangles. However, without further information or specific pairings, determining the exact number of rectangles can be challenging. The given incorrect options suggest the complexity of the problem.; answer: 30\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Clarify the specific pairings of sides and diagonals that form perpendicular pairs in the dodecagon to accurately count the valid rectangles.\nDebate agent cijg, round 0, on counting rectangles, thinking: To determine the number of valid rectangles, we need to ensure that we have two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular to each other. In a regular dodecagon, there are six pairs of parallel sides, and each pair has a perpendicular counterpart. Additionally, each diagonal can form a right angle with another diagonal. However, without a specific systematic approach or diagram to verify each possible rectangle, counting them accurately is complex. The previous attempts at solving this problem resulted in incorrect answers, indicating the difficulty in ensuring all constraints are met.; answer: 300\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide a systematic method or diagram to verify each possible rectangle, ensuring all constraints are met.\nDebate agent TgtA, round 1, on counting rectangles, thinking: The problem involves counting the number of rectangles that can be formed using the sides and diagonals of a regular dodecagon. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular to each other. In a dodecagon, there are 6 sets of parallel sides, and each set has a perpendicular counterpart. Additionally, diagonals can also form right angles with other diagonals. The complexity arises in systematically verifying all possible combinations of these pairs to ensure they form closed rectangles. Given the previous incorrect answers and the complexity of the problem, it is challenging to determine the exact number without a systematic approach or additional information.; answer: 30\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide a systematic approach or additional information about specific pairs of sides and diagonals that form perpendicular pairs in the dodecagon to accurately count the valid rectangles.\nDebate agent cijg, round 1, on counting rectangles, thinking: The task requires counting rectangles formed by pairs of parallel and perpendicular lines in a regular dodecagon.

Each rectangle is formed by selecting two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular to each other.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#34;The current decomposition shows that sub-tasks are still marked with &#39;&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;&#39;, indicating that some tasks are too complex for the existing blocks to handle. The suggestion to provide a systematic approach or additional information about specific pairs of sides and diagonals that form perpendicular pairs in the dodecagon needs to be addressed.

sub_tasks: [&#39;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - To solve this, we need to identify the vertices of a regular dodecagon and list all possible diagonals. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. We can label them as V1, V2, ..., V12. The diagonals are line segments connecting non-adjacent vertices. For each vertex, there are 12 - 3 = 9 possible diagonals, as we exclude the vertex itself and its two adjacent vertices. However, each diagonal is counted twice (once from each endpoint), so the total number of unique diagonals is (12 * 9) / 2.; answer - The vertices of the dodecagon are V1, V2, ..., V12. The total number of unique diagonals is 54.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - A regular dodecagon has 12 sides and 54 unique diagonals. We need to find pairs of parallel lines where each line is either a side or a diagonal. For sides, opposite sides are parallel. There are 6 pairs of opposite sides (since the dodecagon has 12 sides). For diagonals, we find diagonals that are parallel by considering their slopes or directions. Diagonals can be categorized by their step size: a diagonal connecting a vertex to another vertex k steps away. Two diagonals are parallel if they have the same step size. There are 5 possible step sizes for diagonals: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each step size k has 6 parallel diagonals, forming 3 pairs (since 6 diagonals can be paired in 3 ways). Therefore, there are 6 + (3 * 5) pairs of parallel lines.; answer - 21\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular to each other. In a regular dodecagon, opposite sides are parallel and can form rectangles. For diagonals, pairs of diagonals with the same step size are parallel. We need to check for perpendicularity. In a regular polygon, diagonals with step sizes k and 12-k are perpendicular, as they span a 90-degree angle. Thus, we form rectangles by pairing diagonals of complementary step sizes (k, 12-k). For sides, they are perpendicular to diagonals with step size 6. Therefore, we need to count these pairs.; answer - 6\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Verify the perpendicularity of diagonals with step sizes and count rectangles formed by these pairs.\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The problem involves counting rectangles within a regular dodecagon using its sides and diagonals. The challenge is ensuring the correct geometric properties, such as parallelism and perpendicularity, are satisfied to form rectangles. Previous attempts have indicated difficulties in solving this problem without detailed geometric analysis or visualization. The provided answer of 6 is based on incomplete analysis, suggesting the problem is complex without further breakdown.; answer - 6\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Verify the perpendicularity and parallelism of diagonals and sides, and count the rectangles formed by these geometric configurations. A detailed geometric breakdown or visualization might be necessary to correctly count the rectangles.&#39;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent nZCr, on identifying vertices and diagonals, thinking: To solve this, we need to identify the vertices of a regular dodecagon and list all possible diagonals. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. We can label them as V1, V2, ..., V12. The diagonals are line segments connecting non-adjacent vertices. For each vertex, there are 12 - 3 = 9 possible diagonals, as we exclude the vertex itself and its two adjacent vertices.

The total number of unique diagonals is 54.\nCoT-SC agent nswW, on enumerating pairs, thinking: A regular dodecagon has 12 sides and 54 unique diagonals. We need to find pairs of parallel lines where each line is either a side or a diagonal. For sides, opposite sides are parallel. There are 6 pairs of opposite sides (since the dodecagon has 12 sides). For diagonals, we find diagonals that are parallel by considering their slopes or directions. Diagonals can be categorized by their step size: a diagonal connecting a vertex to another vertex k steps away. Two diagonals are parallel if they have the same step size. There are 5 possible step sizes for diagonals: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each step size k has 6 parallel diagonals, forming 3 pairs (since 6 diagonals can be paired in 3 ways). Therefore, there are 6 + (3 * 5) pairs of parallel lines.; answer: 21\nCoT-SC agent WyLM, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To find the pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) in a regular dodecagon, we note that it has 12 sides and 54 unique diagonals. Each side is parallel to exactly one other side. For diagonals, we need to consider diagonals that are parallel to each other. Since the dodecagon is regular, diagonals that are equidistant from the center and symmetrical will be parallel. However, enumerating all such pairs manually is complex because it involves geometric reasoning about which diagonals are parallel given the symmetry of the dodecagon.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: A systematic approach to enumerate parallel pairs of diagonals in a regular dodecagon could involve visualizing or calculating the angles of each diagonal with respect to a fixed line (such as a side) and grouping them by equal angles.\nCoT-SC agent NKKJ, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To enumerate all possible pairs of parallel lines in a regular dodecagon, we need to consider both the sides and the diagonals. A regular dodecagon is symmetric, and its sides form 12 different lines. Each side is parallel to 5 other sides (since 12/2 - 1 = 5). This gives us 6 pairs of parallel sides. For diagonals, we need to consider lines connecting vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center. Each diagonal is parallel to several others, depending on its length and orientation. However, enumerating all pairs of parallel diagonals is complex due to the multiple lengths and orientations possible in a dodecagon. This task requires careful geometric analysis to identify all parallel sets of diagonals.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Enumerate the diagonals based on their lengths and orientations, then identify parallel sets by symmetry or geometric properties.\nCoT-SC agent uCpl, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To enumerate all possible pairs of parallel lines in a regular dodecagon, we need to consider both sides and diagonals. A regular dodecagon has rotational symmetry, and its diagonals can be categorized by their lengths. Each side of the dodecagon is parallel to 5 other sides (since there are 12 sides total), forming 6 sets of parallel lines. For diagonals, we need to consider the different types of diagonals based on their lengths and the angles they form with the sides. Each type of diagonal will also have parallel counterparts, but the exact enumeration depends on the geometry of the dodecagon. Without explicit enumeration of diagonal types, we can state that there are several sets of parallel diagonals, but the exact count requires further analysis of the dodecagon&#39;s symmetry and diagonal properties.; answer: 6 sets of parallel sides. For diagonals, further analysis of diagonal types is needed to enumerate parallel pairs.\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Analyze the lengths and angles of diagonals to determine sets of parallel diagonals.\nCoT-SC agent aAgB, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To enumerate all possible pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) in a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the symmetry and geometry of the shape. A regular dodecagon has 12 sides and several diagonals. Lines are parallel if they are in the same direction, so we need to find lines that are parallel by considering their geometric arrangement. There are 6 sets of parallel sides (each set having 2 sides), and diagonals can be categorized based on their length and orientation. The diagonals can be classified into several groups based on their parallelism. However, without explicit coordinates or a diagram, enumerating all parallel diagonals is complex.; answer: 6\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide a diagram or coordinates of the dodecagon to visually identify parallel diagonals.\nCoT agent w1Uo, on verifying pairs, thinking: To form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular to each other. In a regular dodecagon, opposite sides are parallel and can form rectangles. For diagonals, pairs of diagonals with the same step size are parallel. We need to check for perpendicularity. In a regular polygon, diagonals with step sizes k and 12-k are perpendicular, as they span a 90-degree angle. Thus, we form rectangles by pairing diagonals of complementary step sizes (k, 12-k). For sides, they are perpendicular to diagonals with step size 6. Therefore, we need to count these pairs.; answer: 6\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Verify the perpendicularity of diagonals with step sizes and count rectangles formed by these pairs.\nDebate agent ApdO, round 0, on counting rectangles, thinking: To count the number of valid rectangles, we need to consider pairs of sides and diagonals that can form perpendicular and parallel lines. In a regular dodecagon, each side is parallel to its opposite side, and diagonals can be classified by step sizes. The diagonals with step sizes k and 12-k are perpendicular. We need to count the number of such pairs, ensuring they form closed rectangles.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices, which we can label as V_1, V_2, ..., V_12. Each vertex is connected to 10 other vertices by either a side or a diagonal (since it can&#39;t connect to itself and its adjacent vertices are sides, not diagonals). Therefore, each vertex has 9 diagonals (since 2 connections are sides). We can list the diagonals by considering connections that skip at least one vertex in between.; answer - Vertices: V_1, V_2, ..., V_12. Possible diagonals include: V_1 to V_3, V_1 to V_4, ..., V_1 to V_12; V_2 to V_4, V_2 to V_5, ..., V_2 to V_1; continuing this pattern for each vertex.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To find pairs of parallel lines in a regular dodecagon, we can utilize the symmetry of the shape. A regular dodecagon has rotational symmetry of 30 degrees and reflectional symmetry across lines through opposite vertices or midpoints of opposite sides. The sides of the dodecagon form pairs of parallel lines. Additionally, diagonals that are evenly spaced (such as every 3rd vertex, every 4th vertex, etc.) will also be parallel in pairs. For example, diagonals connecting every 3rd vertex (e.g., V_1 to V_4, V_2 to V_5, etc.) are parallel. Similarly, diagonals connecting every 4th vertex (e.g., V_1 to V_5, V_2 to V_6, etc.) are parallel. We need to consider all such sets of diagonals and sides to enumerate all possible pairs of parallel lines.; answer - Pairs of parallel lines can be formed by: 1. Sides of the dodecagon: (V_1 to V_2, V_7 to V_8), (V_2 to V_3, V_8 to V_9), ..., (V_12 to V_1, V_6 to V_7). 2. Diagonals connecting every 3rd vertex: (V_1 to V_4, V_2 to V_5), (V_3 to V_6, V_4 to V_7), ..., (V_12 to V_3, V_11 to V_2). 3. Diagonals connecting every 4th vertex: (V_1 to V_5, V_2 to V_6), (V_3 to V_7, V_4 to V_8), ..., (V_12 to V_4, V_11 to V_3). 4. Diagonals connecting every 5th vertex: (V_1 to V_6, V_2 to V_7), (V_3 to V_8, V_4 to V_9), ..., (V_12 to V_5, V_11 to V_4). 5. Diagonals connecting every 6th vertex (diameters): (V_1 to V_7, V_2 to V_8), (V_3 to V_9, V_4 to V_10), ..., (V_12 to V_6, V_11 to V_5). Each set of these parallel lines can form potential rectangles.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To determine which pairs of parallel lines can form rectangles with right angles, we need to ensure that the pairs of lines are perpendicular to each other. In a regular dodecagon, the sides are 30 degrees apart, so we need to find pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that are separated by 90 degrees (or a multiple of 90 degrees). This means we are looking for lines that are perpendicular, which can occur if they are spaced by 3 steps (90 degrees) around the vertices of the dodecagon. For example, sides that are 3 steps apart (like V_1 to V_2 and V_4 to V_5) can form a right angle. Similarly, diagonals that connect every 3rd vertex (V_1 to V_4 and V_4 to V_7) are perpendicular. Each pair of parallel lines must be checked to see if there is another pair of parallel lines perpendicular to them to form a rectangle.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Enumerate all sets of perpendicular pairs of parallel lines and verify which can form rectangles by checking if they are spaced by 90 degrees or a multiple of 90 degrees around the dodecagon.\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The problem involves counting the number of rectangles that can be formed using the sides and diagonals of a regular dodecagon. The challenge lies in identifying pairs of parallel lines that can form right angles, ensuring closure to form rectangles, and considering the geometric properties and symmetry of the dodecagon. Previous attempts have resulted in incorrect solutions, indicating the complexity of the task. A systematic enumeration and geometric analysis of the dodecagon&#39;s structure are necessary to arrive at the correct count. However, based on the debate results, both agents arrived at the same answer, suggesting 75 rectangles, though they acknowledge the difficulty of the problem.; answer - 75\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Use a systematic method to enumerate all possible sets of perpendicular pairs of parallel lines in the dodecagon, verify which can form rectangles by ensuring they are spaced by 90 degrees or a multiple of 90 degrees, and count the number of valid rectangles. This requires a detailed geometric analysis of the dodecagon&#39;s structure.&#34;]

Diagonals connecting every 3rd vertex: (V_1 to V_4, V_2 to V_5), (V_3 to V_6, V_4 to V_7), ..., (V_12 to V_3, V_11 to V_2). 3. Diagonals connecting every 4th vertex: (V_1 to V_5, V_2 to V_6), (V_3 to V_7, V_4 to V_8), ..., (V_12 to V_4, V_11 to V_3). 4.

Each set of these parallel lines can form potential rectangles.\nCoT-SC agent ZPTI, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To find pairs of parallel lines in a regular dodecagon, we note that lines are parallel if they are opposite sides or if they are diagonals that are parallel. In a regular dodecagon, opposite sides are parallel due to symmetry. Similarly, diagonals that are equally spaced (e.g., skipping the same number of vertices) are parallel. For sides, each side is parallel to the side directly opposite it. For diagonals, we consider diagonals that skip the same number of vertices. There are several such pairs for each type of diagonal (e.g., diagonals that skip 1 vertex, 2 vertices, etc.).; answer: Pairs of parallel lines include: (V_1, V_2) parallel to (V_7, V_8), (V_2, V_3) parallel to (V_8, V_9), ..., (V_12, V_1) parallel to (V_6, V_7) for sides. For diagonals, (V_1, V_3) parallel to (V_7, V_9), (V_1, V_4) parallel to (V_7, V_10), etc., continuing this pattern for all diagonals that skip the same number of vertices.\nCoT-SC agent xXf8, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To find all possible pairs of parallel lines, we need to consider the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon. The dodecagon has 12 sides, and diagonals can be classified by how many vertices they skip. For example, a diagonal that skips 1 vertex is parallel to another diagonal that also skips 1 vertex but starts from a different initial vertex. Similarly, diagonals that skip 2 vertices are parallel to each other, and so on. We need to consider all such diagonals and sides to identify parallel pairs. However, without a clear listing of the diagonals and their classification by skips, it&#39;s challenging to enumerate all pairs accurately. This requires systematic enumeration or visualization.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: List the diagonals by the number of vertices they skip and identify parallel pairs systematically.\nCoT-SC agent 0NvD, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To find pairs of parallel lines in a regular dodecagon, we consider both sides and diagonals. The dodecagon has rotational symmetry, which helps identify parallel lines. Each side of the dodecagon is parallel to the side opposite it. For diagonals, diagonals connecting vertices that are equidistant will be parallel. For example, diagonals connecting V_1 to V_4 and V_7 to V_10 are parallel due to symmetry. The challenge lies in systematically enumerating all such pairs, including diagonals of different lengths, which can be complex due to the number of combinations involved.; answer: Pairs of parallel lines include: (V_1-V_2, V_7-V_8), (V_2-V_3, V_8-V_9), ..., (V_12-V_1, V_6-V_7); diagonals like (V_1-V_4, V_7-V_10), (V_1-V_5, V_8-V_12), and so on. The enumeration is complex due to the number of vertices and diagonals involved.\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: A systematic approach listing all diagonals and checking for parallelism using symmetry might help clarify the enumeration.\nCoT-SC agent gWcB, on enumerating pairs, thinking: To form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines. In a regular dodecagon, sides and diagonals can form parallel lines. We need to identify all such pairs. Each side of the dodecagon is parallel to the side directly opposite it, and each diagonal is parallel to another diagonal that is diametrically opposite. For a dodecagon, there are 6 pairs of parallel sides and several pairs of parallel diagonals. To find all possible pairs of parallel diagonals, consider the diagonals that skip the same number of vertices. For example, diagonals that skip 1 vertex are parallel, those that skip 2 vertices are parallel, and so on. We need to enumerate these pairs.; answer: Pairs of parallel lines include: 6 pairs of parallel sides (V_1V_2 || V_7V_8, V_2V_3 || V_8V_9, ..., V_6V_7 || V_12V_1); Pairs of parallel diagonals include: diagonals that skip 1 vertex (e.g., V_1V_3 || V_7V_9), diagonals that skip 2 vertices (e.g., V_1V_4 || V_7V_10), and so on up to diagonals that skip 5 vertices.\nCoT agent M3Zi, on verifying pairs, thinking: To determine which pairs of parallel lines can form rectangles with right angles, we need to ensure that the pairs of lines are perpendicular to each other. In a regular dodecagon, the sides are 30 degrees apart, so we need to find pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that are separated by 90 degrees (or a multiple of 90 degrees). This means we are looking for lines that are perpendicular, which can occur if they are spaced by 3 steps (90 degrees) around the vertices of the dodecagon. For example, sides that are 3 steps apart (like V_1 to V_2 and V_4 to V_5) can form a right angle. Similarly, diagonals that connect every 3rd vertex (V_1 to V_4 and V_4 to V_7) are perpendicular. Each pair of parallel lines must be checked to see if there is another pair of parallel lines perpendicular to them to form a rectangle.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Enumerate all sets of perpendicular pairs of parallel lines and verify which can form rectangles by checking if they are spaced by 90 degrees or a multiple of 90 degrees around the dodecagon.\nDebate agent MvCZ, round 0, on counting rectangles, thinking: To solve the problem of counting rectangles in a regular dodecagon, we need to consider all possible pairs of parallel sides and diagonals which can form right angles. The challenge lies in identifying all such pairs and ensuring they form complete rectangles. Given the complexity of this task and the need for a systematic approach to enumerate and verify these pairs, it becomes a problem of combinatorial geometry, which is intricate due to the symmetry and multiple diagonal possibilities in a dodecagon. The problem is further complicated by the need for spatial reasoning to ensure that the selected lines do indeed form closed rectangles.; answer: 75\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider using a systematic approach to enumerate all possible sets of perpendicular pairs of parallel lines in the dodecagon, and verify which sets form valid rectangles by checking for closure and right angles.\nDebate agent Qjp4, round 0, on counting rectangles, thinking: The problem involves determining the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon, where each rectangle&#39;s sides align with either the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. This requires understanding the geometric properties of the dodecagon, especially the angles between sides and diagonals, and ensuring that the pairs of lines are perpendicular to form right angles. The task is complex due to the need to enumerate and verify perpendicular pairs, and the provided information suggests that previous attempts have not been successful. Without a clear enumeration of all possible perpendicular pairs and verification of their ability to form rectangles, it&#39;s challenging to determine the exact count of valid rectangles.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Enumerate all sets of perpendicular pairs of parallel lines in the dodecagon, verify which can form rectangles by ensuring they are spaced by 90 degrees or a multiple of 90 degrees, and count the number of valid rectangles formed.

This involves ensuring that these pairs form right angles and closed shapes, which is a complex combinatorial geometry problem.

The dodecagon has a high degree of symmetry, and the number of diagonals and potential line pairings makes enumeration challenging. Previous attempts have not yielded a correct solution, indicating that the problem may require a more systematic approach to ensure all configurations are considered. The complexity arises from ensuring that the selected pairs form right angles and closed shapes, considering the multiple possibilities for diagonals and their geometric properties.; answer: 75\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Use a systematic method to enumerate all possible sets of perpendicular pairs of parallel lines in the dodecagon, verify which can form rectangles by ensuring they are spaced by 90 degrees or a multiple of 90 degrees, and count the number of valid rectangles.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`
