    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the rotational symmetries of the octagon and how they affect the coloring of the vertices. We have 8 vertices, each colored either red or blue, giving us a total of 2^8 possible colorings. We want to find the probability that a coloring can be rotated into another coloring where all blue vertices occupy positions that were originally red. This is equivalent to saying that the coloring is invariant under some non-trivial rotation. The symmetries of the octagon are given by its rotational group, which has 8 elements (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315 degrees). For a coloring to be invariant under a rotation by k*45 degrees, the coloring must repeat every k vertices. Let&#39;s use Burnside&#39;s lemma to count the number of distinct colorings that are invariant under these rotations. For each rotation, we count the number of colorings that are unchanged by that rotation. For the identity rotation (0 degrees), all 2^8 colorings are unchanged. For a 45-degree rotation, no coloring can be unchanged because all vertices must be the same color, which is not allowed. For a 90-degree rotation, the coloring must repeat every 2 vertices, so there are 2^4 = 16 invariant colorings. For a 135-degree rotation, no coloring can be unchanged. For a 180-degree rotation, the coloring must repeat every 4 vertices, so there are 2^2 = 4 invariant colorings. For a 225-degree rotation, no coloring can be unchanged. For a 270-degree rotation, the coloring must repeat every 2 vertices, so there are 16 invariant colorings. For a 315-degree rotation, no coloring can be unchanged. Applying Burnside&#39;s lemma, the number of distinct colorings is (1/8) * (256 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 16 + 0) = 36. The probability is then 36 / 256 = 9 / 64. Therefore, m = 9 and n = 64, and m + n = 73.
