    "thinking": "Answer ID 0 and Answer ID 2 both correctly apply Burnside's Lemma to determine the number of invariant colorings and calculate the probability as 9/64, yielding m+n=73. Answer ID 5 also follows a similar correct approach to reach the same conclusion. Answer ID 1 incorrectly calculates the number of invariant colorings, leading to the wrong probability of 1/64 and m+n=65. Answer ID 3 incorrectly applies Burnside's Lemma, leading to an incorrect probability of 1/16 and m+n=17. Answer ID 4 incorrectly calculates the number of valid colorings as 70, leading to an incorrect probability of 35/128 and m+n=163. Answer ID 6 incorrectly calculates the number of invariant colorings as 39, leading to an incorrect probability of 39/256 and m+n=295. Therefore, the best answers are provided by Answer ID 0, Answer ID 2, and Answer ID 5, all of which correctly calculate m+n=73.",
