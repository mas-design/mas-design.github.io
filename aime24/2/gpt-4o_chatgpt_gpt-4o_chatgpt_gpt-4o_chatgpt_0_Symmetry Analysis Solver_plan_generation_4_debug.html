    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

    <pre>thought: 
    **Decomposition:**
    The problem can be broken down into several sub-tasks:
    1. **Sub-task 1:** Determine the total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon. Since each vertex can be either red or blue, and there are 8 vertices, the total number of colorings is $2^8$.
    2. **Sub-task 2:** Identify the number of colorings that allow for a rotation such that all blue vertices map to positions originally occupied by red vertices. This involves considering the symmetries of the octagon and calculating the number of valid configurations.
    3. **Sub-task 3:** Calculate the probability that a valid rotation exists. This is the ratio of the number of valid colorings to the total number of colorings.
    4. **Sub-task 4:** Simplify the probability $	frac{m}{n}$ and find $m+n$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
    
    These sub-tasks ensure that each step is manageable and can be addressed by the existing blocks. By solving these sub-tasks, we can find the desired probability and compute $m+n$.

    **Overall Architecture:**
    To solve each sub-task, we can use the following connections between existing blocks:
    - Use the &#34;Chain-of-Thought&#34; (CoT) block to address Sub-task 1, as it requires straightforward calculation.
    - Use the &#34;LLM Debate&#34; block to address Sub-task 2, as it involves considering multiple configurations and symmetries, which can benefit from diverse perspectives.
    - Use the &#34;Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought&#34; (CoT-SC) block to address Sub-task 3, ensuring the probability calculation is consistent.
    - Use the &#34;Self-Refine (Reflexion)&#34; block to address Sub-task 4, refining the simplification of the fraction and ensuring $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.

    **Implementation:**
    - Implement CoT for Sub-task 1 to calculate the total number of colorings.
    - Implement LLM Debate for Sub-task 2 to explore valid configurations and rotations.
    - Implement CoT-SC for Sub-task 3 to calculate the probability consistently.
    - Implement Reflexion for Sub-task 4 to refine and simplify the probability fraction.
    
    This architecture leverages the strengths of each block to solve the problem efficiently.

agents: [&#34;CoT agent Xb6O, on the purpose of calculating total colorings, thinking: Each vertex of the octagon can be colored either red or blue independently, and there are 8 vertices in total. Since each vertex has 2 options, the total number of ways to color the vertices is given by 2 raised to the power of 8.; answer: 256\nDebate agent j6Yc, round 0, on the purpose of identifying valid colorings, thinking: To find the number of colorings that allow for a rotation such that all blue vertices map to positions originally occupied by red vertices, we need to consider the symmetries of the octagon. A regular octagon has 8 rotational symmetries (0 through 7), and we need to find colorings that are invariant under these rotations. For a coloring to allow such a rotation, the number of blue and red vertices must be equal, i.e., 4 blue and 4 red vertices, as each rotation must map blue vertices to positions that were originally red. We can use Burnside&#39;s Lemma to count these colorings, which involves averaging the number of colorings fixed by each rotation. However, without calculating each fixed coloring, determining the exact number of valid colorings is complex.; answer: 16\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Use Burnside&#39;s Lemma to calculate the number of symmetric colorings, considering each rotation of the octagon and counting the colorings that remain unchanged.\nDebate agent mvqS, round 0, on the purpose of identifying valid colorings, thinking: To solve this, we need to consider the symmetries of the octagon that allow the blue vertices to map onto red vertices. A rotation of the octagon by 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, or 315 degrees should map blue vertices to positions originally red. We need to count the number of colorings invariant under these rotations. Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we calculate the number of colorings fixed by each rotation and then average over the total number of rotations.; answer: 30\nDebate agent j6Yc, round 1, on the purpose of identifying valid colorings, thinking: To determine the number of colorings that allow a rotation such that all blue vertices map to positions originally occupied by red vertices, we need to consider the symmetrical properties of the octagon. The octagon has 8 rotational symmetries, and we are interested in colorings where the number of blue vertices equals the number of red vertices, specifically 4 of each. Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we calculate the number of colorings invariant under each rotation. However, without step-by-step calculation of each fixed coloring, determining the exact number is complex.; answer: 70\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Calculate the number of fixed colorings for each rotation using Burnside&#39;s Lemma to find the exact number of valid colorings.\nDebate agent mvqS, round 1, on the purpose of identifying valid colorings, thinking: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the number of colorings of the octagon that are invariant under its rotational symmetries. Each vertex can be colored red or blue, and with 8 vertices, there are 2^8 = 256 total colorings. We seek the number of these colorings that allow a rotation to map all blue vertices to positions originally occupied by red vertices. For this to be possible, the number of red and blue vertices must be equal (4 red and 4 blue). Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we calculate the number of colorings fixed by each rotation and average over the total number of rotations. However, calculating the fixed colorings for each rotation requires detailed consideration of symmetry, which is complex without additional decomposition.; answer: 70\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Decompose the problem further into calculating the fixed colorings for each rotational symmetry using Burnside&#39;s Lemma.\nFinal Decision agent, on the purpose of identifying valid colorings, thinking: The problem involves finding colorings of a regular octagon that are invariant under rotation, specifically where blue vertices can be rotated into positions initially occupied by red vertices.

The probability is the ratio of valid colorings to the total number of colorings.; answer: 35\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nThe detailed calculation of valid colorings using symmetry and Burnside&#39;s Lemma was not provided, so a suggestion is to explicitly calculate fixed colorings for each rotation to verify the count of 70.\nCoT agent BZMJ, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: We know from Sub-task 1 that there are 256 total possible colorings of the octagon. From Sub-task 2, we have that there are 70 valid colorings where a rotation can map all blue vertices to positions originally occupied by red vertices. The probability is the ratio of valid colorings to total colorings, which is 70/256. Simplifying this fraction gives 35/128.

We also have the number of valid colorings that allow for a rotation to map blue vertices to positions originally occupied by red vertices, which is 70. To find the probability of having such a valid rotation, we divide the number of valid colorings by the total number of colorings. This gives us the probability as a fraction, which is 70/256. Simplifying this fraction will give us the probability in its simplest form, which is required to find the relatively prime integers m and n.; answer: 5\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Simplify the fraction 70/256 to find the relatively prime m and n, then add them to find m+n.\nCoT agent XuNL, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: The total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon is 256, as calculated in Sub-task 1. The number of valid colorings, where the octagon can be rotated to match the original coloring with blue vertices in red positions, is given as 70 from Sub-task 2. The probability of such a valid rotation existing is the ratio of valid colorings to total colorings, which is 70/256. Simplifying this fraction gives us the probability in its simplest form. We then need to find m and n from this simplified fraction and sum them to answer the question.; answer: 5\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Simplify the fraction 70/256 to find m and n, then calculate m+n.\nCoT agent Ph4W, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: To calculate the probability, we need to divide the number of valid colorings (where a rotation can map blue vertices to original red positions) by the total number of colorings.

The given fraction 70/256 simplifies to 35/128, as both 70 and 256 are divisible by 2. The numbers 35 and 128 are relatively prime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

The suggestion is to use Burnside&#39;s Lemma to calculate the number of symmetric colorings, which involves further decomposition. This suggests that the decomposition of Sub-task 2 needs to be improved. The other sub-tasks appear solvable, as their answers are consistent with the problem requirements.&#34;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks cover the necessary information to solve the original problem. However, the connection between Sub-task 2 and Sub-task 3 should be strengthened by ensuring that the correct number of valid colorings is determined. This requires addressing the complexity highlighted in Sub-task 2.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score remains at 0%, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This is due to the incorrect calculation of valid colorings in Sub-task 2, which affects the probability calculation in Sub-task 3. Addressing the decomposition of Sub-task 2 will improve the final response.&#39;}

thought: {&#39;Further Decomposion&#39;: &#34;Last Sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 2.1, New Sub-task 2.2. Sub-task 2.1 will focus on calculating the number of fixed colorings for each rotation using Burnside&#39;s Lemma. Sub-task 2.2 will aggregate these results to determine the total number of valid colorings. This decomposition makes the task more manageable by breaking down the complex calculation into simpler steps.&#34;, &#39;Improved subtask architecture&#39;: &#39;Last Sub-task Architecture (LLM Debate) (aims to address Sub-task 2) -&gt; (improve to) New Sub-task Architecture (CoT + Reflexion). The new architecture will use CoT to calculate fixed colorings for each rotation and Reflexion to refine these calculations and ensure accuracy. This provides a structured approach to handle the complex calculations involved.&#39;, &#39;Updated Subtask Instruction&#39;: &#39;It is known that 163 is not correct. This information will be added to the final sub-task to ensure that incorrect answers from previous attempts are avoided.&#39;}

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Each vertex of the octagon can be colored in 2 ways, either red or blue. Since there are 8 vertices, the total number of ways to color the vertices is 2^8.; answer - 256\nSub-task 2.1 output: thinking - To calculate the number of fixed colorings for each rotation using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we need to consider each rotation of the octagon and determine how many colorings remain unchanged by that rotation. The octagon has 8 rotational symmetries (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees). For a coloring to be fixed by a rotation, the pattern of colors must be invariant under that rotation. We will analyze each case: \n1. 0 degrees (identity rotation): All 256 colorings are unchanged.\n2. 45 degrees: For a coloring to remain unchanged, all vertices must be the same color, giving 2 fixed colorings (all red or all blue).\n3. 90 degrees: Vertices can be grouped into 4 pairs (0-2-4-6 and 1-3-5-7). Each pair must be the same color, giving 2^2 = 4 fixed colorings.\n4. 135 degrees: Similar to 45 degrees, all vertices must be the same color, giving 2 fixed colorings.\n5. 180 degrees: Vertices can be grouped into 2 sets of 4 (0-4, 1-5, 2-6, 3-7). Each pair must be the same color, giving 2^4 = 16 fixed colorings.\n6. 225 degrees: Similar to 45 degrees, all vertices must be the same color, giving 2 fixed colorings.\n7. 270 degrees: Similar to 90 degrees, vertices can be grouped into 4 pairs, giving 4 fixed colorings.\n8. 315 degrees: Similar to 45 degrees, all vertices must be the same color, giving 2 fixed colorings.\nUsing Burnside&#39;s Lemma, the total number of fixed colorings is the average of these counts over all rotations.; answer - 288\nSub-task 2.2 output: thinking - Based on the output of Sub-task 2.1, the number of fixed colorings for each rotation was calculated using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, resulting in a total of 288 fixed colorings. With 8 rotational symmetries of the octagon, the number of distinct colorings is the average number of fixed colorings, which is 288 / 8 = 36. This aggregation appears correct according to the application of Burnside&#39;s Lemma.; answer - 36\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To find the probability that a valid rotation exists, we need to divide the number of valid colorings by the total number of colorings. From Sub-task 1, we know there are 256 total colorings. From Sub-task 2.2, we know there are 36 valid colorings. The probability is then 36/256, which simplifies to 9/64. Since 9 and 64 are relatively prime, m = 9 and n = 64. Therefore, m+n = 73.; answer - 73\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The previous attempts consistently arrived at the fraction 36/256, simplifying to 9/64, with m+n=73. However, the problem indicates that 163 is incorrect, suggesting an error in previous assumptions or calculations. This discrepancy implies that there might have been an error in counting the valid colorings or considering the rotational symmetries correctly. Without additional information or a different approach, it&#39;s challenging to resolve this conflict.; answer - 73\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the counting of valid colorings or reconsider the rotational symmetries and constraints that might affect the probability calculation, as the consistent result of 73 conflicts with the problem&#39;s indication that 163 is incorrect.&#34;]

The total number of fixed colorings is 288. According to Burnside&#39;s Lemma, the number of distinct colorings is the average number of fixed colorings over all symmetries.

This aggregation appears correct according to the application of Burnside&#39;s Lemma.; answer: 36\nCoT agent l0l6, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: To find the probability that a valid rotation exists, we need to divide the number of valid colorings (where a rotation can map all blue vertices to original red positions) by the total number of ways to color the vertices. From Sub-task 1, we have 256 total colorings. From Sub-task 2.2, we have 36 valid colorings. The probability is therefore 36/256, which simplifies to 9/64. Thus, m = 9 and n = 64, so m+n = 73.; answer: 73\nCoT agent 9M4U, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: The total number of ways to color the vertices is 256, as each vertex can be colored in 2 ways independently. The number of distinct colorings, considering rotational symmetry, is 36. The probability that a valid rotation exists is the ratio of these two numbers, which is 36/256. Simplifying this fraction gives us 9/64.

From Sub-task 2.2, we know that there are 36 distinct colorings that allow for a valid rotation. The probability that a valid rotation exists is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of colorings, which is 36/256. This fraction can be simplified to 9/64. Therefore, m = 9 and n = 64, and m+n = 73.; answer: 73\nCoT agent nsqy, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: The total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon is 256, as calculated in Sub-task 1. The number of valid colorings that allow for a rotation such that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is 36, as determined in Sub-task 2.2. The probability is the ratio of these two numbers, which is 36/256. Simplifying this fraction gives 9/64. Therefore, the probability that a valid rotation exists is 9/64, where m = 9 and n = 64. Thus, m + n = 73.; answer: 73\nCoT agent TFZA, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: To find the probability that a valid rotation exists, we need to divide the number of valid colorings by the total number of colorings. From Sub-task 1, we know there are 256 total colorings. From Sub-task 2.2, we know there are 36 valid colorings. The probability is then 36/256, which simplifies to 9/64. Since 9 and 64 are relatively prime, m = 9 and n = 64. Therefore, m+n = 73.; answer: 73\nCoT agent yFyM, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: We need to ensure that the fraction representing the probability is simplified and that the sum of the numerator and the denominator is calculated correctly. The probability was found to be 36/256, which simplifies to 9/64. Since 9 and 64 are relatively prime, the fraction is already simplified, and the sum of m and n is 9 + 64.; answer: 73\nCritic agent 4twk, on the purpose of reviewing simplification, thinking: The given fraction 36/256 simplifies to 9/64 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. The sum of the simplified numerator and denominator, 9 and 64, is 73.; answer: The simplification of 36/256 to 9/64 is correct, and the sum 9 + 64 is indeed 73.\nCoT agent yFyM, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The problem states that the probability of a valid rotation is given by a fraction that needs to be simplified. From the previous sub-tasks, the fraction was 36/256, which simplifies to 9/64. The numbers 9 and 64 are already relatively prime, so the fraction is in its simplest form. The sum of the numerator and denominator, 9 and 64, is 73.; answer: 73\nCritic agent 4twk, on the purpose of reviewing simplification, thinking: The simplification of the fraction 36/256 to 9/64 is correct, as 9 and 64 are relatively prime. The sum of 9 and 64 is indeed 73.; answer: Yes, the simplification and the sum m+n=73 are correct.\nCoT agent yFyM, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The problem involves simplifying the probability fraction of valid colorings to total colorings of a regular octagon and ensuring the fraction is in its simplest form. The probability was initially calculated as 36/256 in previous sub-tasks, which simplifies to 9/64. The numbers 9 and 64 are relatively prime, confirming that the simplification is correct. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator, 9 and 64, is 73, which matches the expected result.; answer: 73\nCritic agent 4twk, on the purpose of reviewing simplification, thinking: The simplification of the fraction 36/256 to 9/64 is correct. The numbers 9 and 64 are relatively prime, and their sum is 73.; answer: The sum of the simplified fraction&#39;s numerator and denominator is 73.\nCoT agent yFyM, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The task is to simplify the fraction representing the probability of a valid rotation of a colored octagon and ensure the sum of the numerator and denominator is calculated correctly. The previous calculations consistently show the fraction as 36/256, which simplifies to 9/64. The numbers 9 and 64 are relatively prime, leading to a sum of 73. However, the problem indicates that 163 is not correct, suggesting a possible error in the assumptions or calculations leading to the fraction. The potential discrepancy might stem from an incorrect count of valid colorings or an overlooked constraint, requiring a re-evaluation of the setup or approach.; answer: 73\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the counting of valid colorings or constraints that might affect the probability calculation, as the current consistent result of 73 conflicts with the problem&#39;s indication that 163 is incorrect.\nCritic agent 4twk, on the purpose of reviewing simplification, thinking: The calculations should be reviewed carefully, as the previous result of 73 was incorrect according to the problem statement.; answer: The correct simplification should be re-evaluated, as it seems there was an error in the assumptions or calculations.\nCoT agent yFyM, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The problem involves finding a probability that a regular octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices align with positions that were originally red. Initially, the probability was calculated as 36/256, simplified to 9/64, with m+n=73. However, the problem indicates that 163 is not correct, suggesting an error. The discrepancy might be due to an incorrect count of valid colorings or an overlooked constraint. Re-evaluating the counting process and ensuring all symmetries and constraints are considered might lead to the correct answer.; answer: 73\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the counting of valid colorings or constraints that might affect the probability calculation, as the current consistent result of 73 conflicts with the problem&#39;s indication that 163 is incorrect.\nCritic agent 4twk, on the purpose of reviewing simplification, thinking: The answer 73 was previously calculated, but the problem indicates that 163 is not correct, suggesting a mistake in the process.; answer: 163\nCoT agent yFyM, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The previous attempts consistently arrived at the fraction 36/256, simplifying to 9/64, with m+n=73.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Each vertex of the octagon can be colored either red or blue independently, and there are 8 vertices in total. Therefore, the number of ways to color the vertices is 2^8.; answer - 256\nSub-task 2.1 output: thinking - To calculate the number of fixed colorings for each rotation using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, I need to consider the symmetries of the octagon, which includes 8 rotational symmetries. For each rotation, I need to determine how many colorings remain unchanged. For a rotation by 0 degrees (identity), all 256 colorings are unchanged. For a rotation by 45 degrees, a coloring is unchanged if all vertices are the same color, which gives 2 colorings. For a rotation by 90 degrees, pairs of opposite vertices must be the same color, resulting in 2^4 = 16 colorings. For a rotation by 135 degrees, the same condition as 45 degrees applies, giving 2 colorings. For 180 degrees, opposite vertices must match, giving 2^4 = 16 colorings. For 225 degrees, the same condition as 45 degrees applies, giving 2 colorings. For 270 degrees, opposite vertices must match, giving 16 colorings. For 315 degrees, the same condition as 45 degrees applies, giving 2 colorings. Summing these gives the total number of fixed colorings for each rotation.; answer - 312\nSub-task 2.2 output: thinking - Based on the output of Sub-task 2.1, we have calculated the total number of fixed colorings for each rotation using Burnside&#39;s Lemma. The sum of these fixed colorings is 312. There are 8 rotational symmetries for the octagon, so according to Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we divide the total number of fixed colorings by the number of symmetries to find the total number of valid colorings. Therefore, 312 divided by 8 gives us 39 valid colorings. This calculation has been verified multiple times and is consistent with the application of Burnside&#39;s Lemma.; answer - 39\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon is 256, as determined in Sub-task 1. The number of valid colorings, where a rotation exists that maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red, is 39, as determined in Sub-task 2.2. The probability that a valid rotation exists is the ratio of the number of valid colorings to the total number of colorings, which is 39/256. We need to express this probability as a reduced fraction \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime. The greatest common divisor of 39 and 256 is 1, so the fraction is already reduced. Therefore, \\( m = 39 \\) and \\( n = 256 \\), and we need to find \\( m + n = 39 + 256 = 295 \\).; answer - 295\nSub-task 4.1 output: thinking - The problem involves calculating the probability that a regular octagon, with vertices independently colored red or blue, can be rotated such that all blue vertices map to positions that were originally red. The total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256, and the number of valid colorings was found to be 39. The probability was given as 39/256, which was already reduced. However, the question asks to reevaluate the counting of valid colorings, ensuring rotational symmetries and constraints are correctly considered. This requires a detailed combinatorial analysis considering rotational symmetries of the octagon, which may be complex to verify without additional information or a step-by-step breakdown of the counting process. Thus, while the original solution seems correct, verifying it from scratch involves intricate combinatorial reasoning.; answer - 295\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide a detailed breakdown of the rotational symmetry considerations and how the 39 valid colorings were counted, ensuring all cases of symmetry and color distribution are covered.\nSub-task 4.2 output: thinking - The problem involves calculating the probability that a regular octagon, with vertices independently colored red or blue, can be rotated such that all blue vertices map to positions that were originally red. The total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256, and the number of valid colorings was given as 39, leading to a probability of 39/256. This fraction is already in its simplest form, as 39 and 256 are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 39 and n = 256, resulting in m+n = 295. However, without additional verification of the 39 valid colorings, there is some uncertainty. The answer remains 295, but further breakdown of how the 39 valid colorings were counted would be beneficial to ensure accuracy.; answer - 295\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide a detailed breakdown of the rotational symmetry considerations and how the 39 valid colorings were counted, ensuring all cases of symmetry and color distribution are covered.&#34;]

For 225 degrees, the same condition as 45 degrees applies, giving 2 colorings. For 270 degrees, opposite vertices must match, giving 16 colorings. For 315 degrees, the same condition as 45 degrees applies, giving 2 colorings. Summing these gives the total number of fixed colorings for each rotation.; answer: 312\nCoT agent VP0Y, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: To determine the total number of valid colorings using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we need to divide the sum of the fixed colorings for each rotation by the number of symmetries (8 in this case). From the output of Sub-task 2.1, we have a total of 312 fixed colorings across all rotations. Therefore, the total number of valid colorings is 312 divided by 8.; answer: 39\nCritic agent X2Vl, on the purpose of reviewing aggregation, thinking: The aggregation of the results using Burnside&#39;s Lemma is correct. The total number of fixed colorings across all rotations is given as 312, and there are 8 symmetries (rotations) for the octagon. Dividing 312 by 8 gives the correct total number of valid colorings, which is 39.; answer: 39\nCoT agent VP0Y, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: We have already calculated the total number of fixed colorings for each rotation using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, which sums to 312. Since there are 8 rotational symmetries of the octagon, we divide the total number of fixed colorings by 8 to get the number of distinct colorings that satisfy the symmetry condition. This gives us 312 / 8 = 39 valid colorings.; answer: 39\nCritic agent X2Vl, on the purpose of reviewing aggregation, thinking: The aggregation appears to be correct. The total number of fixed colorings for each rotation was calculated to be 312 using Burnside&#39;s Lemma. Dividing by the 8 rotational symmetries of the octagon gives 39 distinct colorings.; answer: Yes, the aggregation of the results is correct, resulting in 39 valid colorings.\nCoT agent VP0Y, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: The task is to determine the total number of valid colorings using Burnside&#39;s Lemma based on the fixed colorings for each rotation. From Sub-task 2.1, the total number of fixed colorings is 312. There are 8 rotational symmetries of the octagon, so according to Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we divide the total number of fixed colorings by the number of symmetries to find the number of distinct valid colorings. Therefore, the calculation is 312 divided by 8, which equals 39. This matches the previously verified answers.; answer: 39\nCritic agent X2Vl, on the purpose of reviewing aggregation, thinking: The aggregation of results using Burnside&#39;s Lemma appears correct. The total number of fixed colorings for each rotation is given as 312, and dividing by the 8 rotational symmetries yields 39, which is consistent with the expected outcome.; answer: 39\nCoT agent VP0Y, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: The task is to determine the total number of valid colorings using Burnside&#39;s Lemma based on the fixed colorings for each rotation.

Burnside&#39;s Lemma tells us to divide this total by the number of symmetries, which is 8 for a regular octagon, to find the number of distinct valid colorings. Therefore, 312 divided by 8 gives 39. This calculation has been verified multiple times, confirming that the aggregation is correct.; answer: 39\nCritic agent X2Vl, on the purpose of reviewing aggregation, thinking: The aggregation of the results using Burnside&#39;s Lemma is correctly applied. The total number of fixed colorings is 312, and dividing by the number of symmetries (8) gives 39 distinct valid colorings.; answer: 39\nCoT agent VP0Y, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: Based on the output of Sub-task 2.1, we have calculated the total number of fixed colorings for each rotation using Burnside&#39;s Lemma. The sum of these fixed colorings is 312. There are 8 rotational symmetries for the octagon, so according to Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we divide the total number of fixed colorings by the number of symmetries to find the total number of valid colorings. Therefore, 312 divided by 8 gives us 39 valid colorings. This calculation has been verified multiple times and is consistent with the application of Burnside&#39;s Lemma.; answer: 39\nCoT agent 4qcI, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: To find the probability that a valid rotation exists, we need to divide the number of valid colorings by the total number of colorings. From Sub-task 1, we know there are 256 total colorings. From Sub-task 2.2, we have 39 valid colorings. Therefore, the probability is 39/256. To express this probability as a reduced fraction m/n, we find the greatest common divisor of 39 and 256, which is 1, meaning the fraction is already in simplest form. Thus, m = 39 and n = 256, and m + n = 39 + 256 = 295.; answer: 295\nCoT agent l0J2, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: We have the total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon, which is 256, from Sub-task 1. From Sub-task 2.2, we have the number of valid colorings where a rotation can map all blue vertices to positions originally occupied by red vertices, which is 39. The probability that such a valid rotation exists is the ratio of valid colorings to the total number of colorings, which is 39/256. We need to express this probability in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime, and then find m+n. The fraction 39/256 is already in simplest form since 39 and 256 have no common factors other than 1. Thus, m = 39 and n = 256, so m+n = 295.; answer: 295\nCoT agent 9Wvk, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: To calculate the probability that a valid rotation exists, we need to divide the number of valid colorings by the total number of colorings. From Sub-task 1, the total number of ways to color the vertices is 256. From Sub-task 2.2, the total number of valid colorings is 39. Therefore, the probability is 39/256. We need to express this probability as a reduced fraction m/n, where m and n are relatively prime. 39 and 256 are already relatively prime, so the fraction is in its simplest form.

From Sub-task 1, we know there are 256 total colorings. From Sub-task 2.2, we know there are 39 valid colorings. Therefore, the probability is 39/256. We need to express this probability in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime. Simplifying 39/256, we find that 39 and 256 are already coprime, so m = 39 and n = 256. Thus, m+n = 39 + 256.; answer: 295\nCoT agent iuFX, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: The total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon is 256, as determined in Sub-task 1. The number of valid colorings, where a rotation exists that maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red, is 39, as determined in Sub-task 2.2. The probability that a valid rotation exists is the ratio of the number of valid colorings to the total number of colorings, which is 39/256. We need to express this probability as a reduced fraction \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime. The greatest common divisor of 39 and 256 is 1, so the fraction is already reduced. Therefore, \\( m = 39 \\) and \\( n = 256 \\), and we need to find \\( m + n = 39 + 256 = 295 \\).; answer: 295\nCoT agent 0GYu, on the purpose of reevaluating valid colorings, thinking: The problem involves calculating the probability that a regular octagon, with vertices independently colored red or blue, can be rotated such that all blue vertices map to positions that were originally red. The total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256, and the number of valid colorings was found to be 39. The probability was given as 39/256, which was already reduced. However, the question asks to reevaluate the counting of valid colorings, ensuring rotational symmetries and constraints are correctly considered. This requires a detailed combinatorial analysis considering rotational symmetries of the octagon, which may be complex to verify without additional information or a step-by-step breakdown of the counting process. Thus, while the original solution seems correct, verifying it from scratch involves intricate combinatorial reasoning.; answer: 295\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide a detailed breakdown of the rotational symmetry considerations and how the 39 valid colorings were counted, ensuring all cases of symmetry and color distribution are covered.\nDebate agent uzM6, round 0, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The problem involves determining the probability that a regular octagon with vertices independently colored red or blue can be rotated such that all blue vertices map to positions that were originally red.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

There are 8 possible rotations (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315 degrees). For each rotation, we count the number of colorings that remain unchanged. \n\n1. 0 degrees: All 256 colorings remain fixed.\n2. 45 degrees: No coloring remains fixed because each vertex must match the color of the next vertex.\n3. 90 degrees: The octagon is divided into 4 pairs of opposite vertices.

Each pair must be the same color, so there are 2^4 = 16 fixed colorings.\n8. 315 degrees: No coloring remains fixed because each vertex must match the color of the next vertex.\n\nUsing Burnside&#39;s Lemma, the number of distinct colorings is the average number of fixed colorings across all rotations.; answer - The total number of fixed colorings is 256 (0 degrees) + 0 (45 degrees) + 16 (90 degrees) + 0 (135 degrees) + 16 (180 degrees) + 0 (225 degrees) + 16 (270 degrees) + 0 (315 degrees) = 304.\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Calculate the average number of fixed colorings by dividing the total by the number of rotations (8) to find the number of distinct colorings.\nSub-task 2.2 output: thinking - The problem involves determining the number of distinct colorings of a regular octagon using Burnside&#39;s Lemma. We have calculated the total number of fixed colorings for each rotation and found it to be 304. There are 8 rotations of the octagon, so using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, the number of distinct colorings is the total number of fixed colorings divided by the number of rotations, which is 304 / 8 = 38. This has been verified multiple times and is consistent with the application of Burnside&#39;s Lemma.; answer - 38\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We have already calculated the total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon, which is 256. We also calculated the number of distinct colorings using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, which is 38. These distinct colorings represent the cases where a valid rotation exists such that all blue vertices can be moved to positions originally occupied by red vertices. The probability that a valid rotation exists is thus the number of distinct colorings divided by the total number of colorings, which is 38/256. Simplifying this fraction gives 19/128. Therefore, m = 19 and n = 128, and m + n = 147.; answer - 147\nSub-task 4.1 output: thinking - To provide a detailed breakdown of the rotational symmetries and their effects on colorings, we need to consider the symmetries of the regular octagon. The octagon has 8 rotational symmetries: 0 degrees (the identity), 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 135 degrees, 180 degrees, 225 degrees, 270 degrees, and 315 degrees. For each symmetry, we need to determine how many colorings remain unchanged. Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we consider each rotation and count the number of colorings fixed by that rotation. This was previously done to determine the number of distinct colorings, which was found to be 38. The identity rotation (0 degrees) fixes all 256 colorings. A 45-degree rotation fixes only those colorings where all vertices are the same color, i.e., 2 colorings. A 90-degree rotation fixes colorings where opposite vertices have the same color, resulting in 16 fixed colorings. A 135-degree rotation also fixes 2 colorings. A 180-degree rotation fixes 16 colorings, as does a 270-degree rotation, and a 225-degree rotation fixes 2 colorings. The 315-degree rotation fixes 2 colorings. The total number of fixed colorings, divided by the number of symmetries (8), gives the number of distinct colorings, which is 38. This breakdown shows how each symmetry affects the colorings, leading to the probability calculation in Sub-task 3.; answer - The octagon has 8 rotational symmetries: 0 degrees (identity), 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 135 degrees, 180 degrees, 225 degrees, 270 degrees, and 315 degrees. For 0 degrees, all 256 colorings are fixed. For 45 and 135 degrees, only colorings where all vertices are the same are fixed, giving 2 each. For 90 and 180 degrees, opposite vertices must match, fixing 16 each. For 225 and 315 degrees, 2 are fixed. For 270 degrees, 16 are fixed. Total fixed colorings: 256 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 16 + 2 = 304. Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, distinct colorings = 304 / 8 = 38. This breakdown shows how symmetries affect colorings. 38 distinct colorings lead to the probability 19/128 in Sub-task 3.\nSub-task 4.2 output: thinking - The task is to verify the counting of valid colorings with respect to the rotational symmetries of the octagon. According to Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we count the number of colorings fixed by each rotation. The symmetry breakdown given is: 0 degrees fixes all 256 colorings, 45 and 135 degrees each fix 2 colorings (all vertices the same color), 90 and 180 degrees each fix 16 colorings (opposite vertices match), 225 and 315 degrees each fix 2 colorings, and 270 degrees fixes 16 colorings. Summing these gives 304 fixed colorings total. Dividing by the 8 symmetries gives 38 distinct colorings, which matches the previous result. This verifies the count is consistent with Burnside&#39;s Lemma.; answer - The counting of valid colorings with respect to symmetries is verified as correct. The total number of fixed colorings is 304, and dividing by 8 gives 38 distinct colorings, consistent with Burnside&#39;s Lemma.\nSub-task 4.3 output: thinking - The task involves simplifying the probability fraction derived from the number of valid colorings (38) and the total number of possible colorings (256) of the octagon. The fraction 38/256 simplifies to 19/128, as 19 and 128 have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the integers m and n are 19 and 128, respectively. The sum of m and n is 147.; answer - 147&#34;]

For 0 degrees, all 256 colorings are fixed. For 45 and 135 degrees, only colorings where all vertices are the same are fixed, giving 2 each. For 90 and 180 degrees, opposite vertices must match, fixing 16 each. For 225 and 315 degrees, 2 are fixed. For 270 degrees, 16 are fixed. Total fixed colorings: 256 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 16 + 2 + 16 + 2 = 304. Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, distinct colorings = 304 / 8 = 38. This breakdown shows how symmetries affect colorings. 38 distinct colorings lead to the probability 19/128 in Sub-task 3.\nReflexion agent G45y, on the purpose of verifying colorings, thinking: The task is to verify the counting of valid colorings with respect to the rotational symmetries of the octagon. According to Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we count the number of colorings fixed by each rotation. The symmetry breakdown given is: 0 degrees fixes all 256 colorings, 45 and 135 degrees each fix 2 colorings (all vertices the same color), 90 and 180 degrees each fix 16 colorings (opposite vertices match), 225 and 315 degrees each fix 2 colorings, and 270 degrees fixes 16 colorings. Summing these gives 304 fixed colorings total. Dividing by the 8 symmetries gives 38 distinct colorings, which matches the previous result. This verifies the count is consistent with Burnside&#39;s Lemma.; answer: The counting of valid colorings with respect to symmetries is verified as correct. The total number of fixed colorings is 304, and dividing by 8 gives 38 distinct colorings, consistent with Burnside&#39;s Lemma.\nDebate agent N2k4, round 0, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: Based on the verification, there are 38 distinct colorings that respect the rotational symmetries of the octagon. Since each vertex can be independently colored red or blue with equal probability, there are a total of 256 possible colorings (2^8). The probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up at positions originally occupied by red vertices is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of colorings, which is 38/256. Simplifying this fraction gives 19/128, where 19 and 128 are relatively prime. Therefore, m = 19 and n = 128, and their sum is m + n = 147.; answer: 147\nDebate agent wVgF, round 0, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The task is to simplify the probability fraction obtained from the number of valid colorings and total colorings. We know there are 38 distinct colorings that satisfy the condition, and the total number of ways to color the octagon is 256 (since each vertex can be colored in 2 ways, and there are 8 vertices). Therefore, the probability is 38/256. Simplifying this fraction gives 19/128. Thus, m = 19 and n = 128, and their sum is 19 + 128.; answer: 147\nDebate agent N2k4, round 1, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The task is to simplify the probability fraction derived from the number of valid colorings (38) and the total number of possible colorings (256) of the octagon. The fraction 38/256 simplifies to 19/128, as 19 and 128 have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the integers m and n are 19 and 128, respectively. The sum of m and n is 19 + 128.; answer: 147\nDebate agent wVgF, round 1, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The problem involves calculating a probability by finding the number of valid colorings that respect rotational symmetry and dividing it by the total number of possible colorings. We verified that there are 38 valid colorings and 256 total colorings. Simplifying the fraction 38/256 gives 19/128, which are relatively prime. Thus, m = 19 and n = 128, and their sum is 147. This matches the simplified fraction and ensures the calculation is correct.; answer: 147\nFinal Decision agent, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The task involves simplifying the probability fraction derived from the number of valid colorings (38) and the total number of possible colorings (256) of the octagon. The fraction 38/256 simplifies to 19/128, as 19 and 128 have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the integers m and n are 19 and 128, respectively. The sum of m and n is 147.; answer: 147&#34;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#34;The current sub-tasks show that Sub-task 4.1 is marked with &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that the task is too complex for the current block. The suggestion is to calculate the average number of fixed colorings by dividing the total by the number of rotations, which implies a need for further decomposition or a more detailed breakdown of the rotational symmetries. This suggests that the task decomposition is not yet optimal, and the architecture might not be fully leveraging the blocks&#39; capabilities.&#34;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks include most of the necessary information from the original query, but there seems to be a disconnect in ensuring that all rotational symmetries and constraints are considered. The breakdown of symmetries needs to be more detailed to ensure completeness.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score remains at 0%, indicating an incorrect final response.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - Each vertex of the octagon can be colored in 2 ways (red or blue). Since there are 8 vertices, the total number of ways to color the vertices is 2^8.; answer - 256\nSub-task 2.1 output: thinking - To calculate the number of fixed colorings for each rotation using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we consider the symmetries of the octagon, which include 8 rotations (0 to 7). For each rotation, we count the colorings that remain unchanged. A coloring is fixed by a rotation if, after applying the rotation, the coloring looks the same as before. We need to calculate the number of such fixed colorings for each rotation.; answer - For rotation 0, all 256 colorings are fixed. For rotation 1, no colorings are fixed because all vertices must be the same color, which is impossible given the problem constraints. For rotation 2, no colorings are fixed because the octagon must be colored in alternating colors, which is impossible given the constraint of equal probability. For rotation 3, no colorings are fixed for similar reasons. For rotation 4, 2 colorings are fixed (all red or all blue). For rotation 5, no colorings are fixed. For rotation 6, no colorings are fixed. For rotation 7, no colorings are fixed. Therefore, the number of fixed colorings is 256 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 258. &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; Suggestion: Calculate the probability of the octagon being rotatable such that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices.\nSub-task 2.2 output: thinking - The problem involves using Burnside&#39;s Lemma to determine the number of distinct colorings of a regular octagon that are invariant under its rotational symmetries. According to the calculations given, there are 258 fixed colorings across all rotations. Dividing by the number of symmetries (8) should yield the number of distinct colorings. However, the repeated suggestion that 32 is the result, despite the division suggesting otherwise, indicates a misunderstanding or miscalculation in the fixed colorings or the application of Burnside&#39;s Lemma. The consistent feedback suggests re-evaluating the fixed colorings, especially for rotations like 4, to ensure the division yields an integer. The previous answers consistently state 32, but there is no clear resolution to the discrepancy in the division.; answer - 32\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Review the fixed coloring calculations for each rotation, especially rotation 4, to ensure they align with the symmetry requirements and that the division by 8 yields an integer.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We have the total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon, which is 256. We also have the number of distinct colorings that are invariant under rotation, which is 32. The probability that a valid rotation exists is the ratio of these two numbers. Therefore, the probability is 32/256, which simplifies to 1/8. The problem states that this probability is \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime. Here, \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 8 \\), so \\( m+n = 1+8 = 9 \\).; answer - 9\nSub-task 4.1.1 output: thinking - To calculate the number of fixed colorings for each rotation, we need to consider the symmetries of the octagon. The octagon has 8 rotational symmetries (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315 degrees). For each symmetry, we calculate the number of colorings that remain unchanged. For a rotation by 0 degrees (identity), all 256 colorings are fixed. For a rotation by 180 degrees, each pair of opposite vertices must be the same color, resulting in 2^4 = 16 fixed colorings. For a rotation by 90 or 270 degrees, the octagon can be divided into 4 groups of 2 vertices, each pair must be the same color, resulting in 2^2 = 4 fixed colorings. For a rotation by 45, 135, 225, or 315 degrees, the octagon can be divided into 8 pairs, each pair must be the same color, resulting in 2 fixed colorings. These calculations match Burnside&#39;s lemma, which was used to find the number of distinct colorings invariant under rotation (32).; answer - Rotation by 0 degrees: 256 fixed colorings\nRotation by 180 degrees: 16 fixed colorings\nRotation by 90 or 270 degrees: 4 fixed colorings\nRotation by 45, 135, 225, or 315 degrees: 2 fixed colorings\nSub-task 4.1.2 output: thinking - Burnside&#39;s Lemma states that the number of distinct objects (colorings, in this case) is the average number of fixed objects under the group actions. In this problem, the group actions are the rotations of the octagon. We have calculated the number of fixed colorings for each rotation: 256 for 0 degrees, 16 for 180 degrees, 4 for 90 and 270 degrees, and 2 for 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees. Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we sum these fixed colorings and divide by the number of symmetries (8): (256 + 16 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2) / 8 = 32. This matches the result from Burnside&#39;s Lemma, verifying the calculations are correct.; answer - The calculations align with Burnside&#39;s Lemma, confirming the results.\nSub-task 4.2 output: thinking - The task is to simplify the probability fraction obtained from the problem. According to the solution, using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we determined that there are 32 distinct colorings out of 256 total colorings. This gives a probability of 32/256, which simplifies to 1/8. Therefore, m = 1 and n = 8, and they are relatively prime.; answer - 1/8&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent uiOM, on the purpose of calculating total colorings, thinking: Each vertex of the octagon can be colored in 2 ways (red or blue). Since there are 8 vertices, the total number of ways to color the vertices is 2^8.; answer: 256\nCoT agent Cp3c, on the purpose of calculating fixed colorings, thinking: To calculate the number of fixed colorings for each rotation using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we consider the symmetries of the octagon, which include 8 rotations (0 to 7). For each rotation, we count the colorings that remain unchanged. A coloring is fixed by a rotation if, after applying the rotation, the coloring looks the same as before. We need to calculate the number of such fixed colorings for each rotation.; answer: For rotation 0, all 256 colorings are fixed. For rotation 1, no colorings are fixed because all vertices must be the same color, which is impossible given the problem constraints. For rotation 2, no colorings are fixed because the octagon must be colored in alternating colors, which is impossible given the constraint of equal probability. For rotation 3, no colorings are fixed for similar reasons. For rotation 4, 2 colorings are fixed (all red or all blue). For rotation 5, no colorings are fixed. For rotation 6, no colorings are fixed. For rotation 7, no colorings are fixed. Therefore, the number of fixed colorings is 256 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 258. &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; Suggestion: Calculate the probability of the octagon being rotatable such that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices.\nCoT agent uFZP, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: Burnside&#39;s Lemma tells us to average the number of fixed colorings over all symmetries of the octagon. We calculated the number of fixed colorings for each rotation in Sub-task 2.1. To find the total number of valid colorings, we sum these fixed colorings and divide by the number of symmetries (8).; answer: 32\nCritic agent 1Jzi, on the purpose of reviewing aggregation, thinking: The aggregation appears correct based on the use of Burnside&#39;s Lemma and the calculation of fixed colorings.; answer: Yes\nCoT agent uFZP, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we sum the number of fixed colorings for each rotation and divide by the number of symmetries (8) to find the total number of valid colorings. From Sub-task 2.1, we have 258 fixed colorings across all rotations. Dividing by 8, we get 258/8 = 32.25. However, this seems incorrect as it should be an integer. The mistake might be in the calculation of fixed colorings, particularly for rotations like 0 and 4. Re-evaluating these, for rotation 0, all 256 colorings are indeed fixed. For rotation 4, only 2 colorings are fixed (all red or all blue), which matches the symmetry requirements. Re-summing gives 258 fixed colorings, which when divided by 8 still results in 32.25, indicating a miscalculation or oversight in Burnside&#39;s application.; answer: 32\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Review the calculation of fixed colorings for each rotation, especially rotations 0 and 4, to ensure they are consistent with the symmetry requirements.\nCritic agent 1Jzi, on the purpose of reviewing aggregation, thinking: The calculation of fixed colorings for each rotation needs to be reviewed, especially for rotations 0 and 4. Burnside&#39;s Lemma should give an integer result, indicating a miscalculation.; answer: 32\nCoT agent uFZP, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: To determine the total number of valid colorings using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we need to correctly calculate the number of fixed colorings for each rotation of the octagon. The number of fixed colorings for rotation 0 is 256, as all colorings are fixed. For rotation 4, only 2 colorings are fixed: all vertices the same color. Other rotations have no fixed colorings due to the symmetry constraints. Summing these gives 258 fixed colorings. Dividing by 8 (the number of rotations) yields the average number of valid colorings. However, the division 258/8 should result in an integer, indicating a mistake in the calculation or interpretation of fixed colorings. Re-evaluating, the correct number of fixed colorings for rotation 4 should be double-checked, as it should satisfy the symmetry requirements. The previous calculation error suggests a need to review the symmetry constraints and fixed coloring counts.; answer: 32\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Review the calculation of fixed colorings for each rotation, especially rotations 0 and 4, to ensure they are consistent with the symmetry requirements.\nCritic agent 1Jzi, on the purpose of reviewing aggregation, thinking: The solution involves using Burnside&#39;s Lemma to count the number of distinct colorings that are invariant under the rotations of the octagon. The mistake seems to be in the calculation of fixed colorings for certain rotations. Specifically, the calculation for rotation 4 and possibly others needs to be checked to ensure it matches the symmetry constraints. The correct application of Burnside&#39;s Lemma should lead to an integer result after dividing the total number of fixed colorings by the number of rotations.; answer: 32\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Review the calculation of fixed colorings for each rotation, especially rotations 0 and 4, to ensure they are consistent with the symmetry requirements.\nCoT agent uFZP, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: Burnside&#39;s Lemma is used to find the number of distinct colorings by averaging the number of fixed colorings over all symmetries. The mistake in previous calculations seems to be in determining the number of fixed colorings for certain rotations, particularly rotation 4. Correct application should yield an integer result. Re-evaluating, the fixed colorings should be 256 for rotation 0, 0 for rotations 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 2 for rotation 4. This gives a total of 258 fixed colorings, and dividing by 8 should yield an integer, indicating a miscalculation in previous attempts.; answer: 32\nCritic agent 1Jzi, on the purpose of reviewing aggregation, thinking: The aggregation of fixed colorings using Burnside&#39;s Lemma seems correct. The calculations indicate 256 fixed colorings for rotation 0, 0 fixed colorings for rotations 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 2 fixed colorings for rotation 4, leading to a total of 258 fixed colorings. Dividing by 8 gives 32 distinct colorings, which is consistent with the expected integer result.; answer: 32\nCoT agent uFZP, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: To determine the total number of valid colorings, we apply Burnside&#39;s Lemma, which involves calculating the average number of fixed colorings over all symmetries of the octagon. In Sub-task 2.1, it was determined that there are 258 fixed colorings across all rotations. Dividing this by the number of symmetries (8) should yield an integer result, which represents the number of distinct colorings. The previous attempts consistently reported 32 as the result of this division. However, the feedback indicates that there might be an error in the calculation of fixed colorings, particularly for rotation 4. Despite this, the consistent conclusion across multiple attempts suggests 32 is correct.; answer: 32\nCritic agent 1Jzi, on the purpose of reviewing aggregation, thinking: The aggregation appears consistent with the use of Burnside&#39;s Lemma, dividing the total fixed colorings by the number of symmetries.; answer: 32\nCoT agent uFZP, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: The problem involves using Burnside&#39;s Lemma to determine the number of distinct colorings of a regular octagon that are invariant under its rotational symmetries.

The number of valid colorings, as determined by symmetry considerations and potentially using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, is 32. The probability that a valid rotation exists is the ratio of these valid colorings to the total colorings.; answer: 1\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Ensure the fixed coloring calculations for each rotation are correct and that the division by the number of symmetries gives an integer result.\nCoT agent 9xeK, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: The total number of ways to color the vertices is 256, as each vertex can be independently colored red or blue. From Sub-task 2.2, the number of valid colorings that allow the octagon to be rotated such that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices is given as 32. The probability is the ratio of the number of valid colorings to the total number of colorings, which is 32/256. Simplifying this fraction gives 1/8, so m = 1 and n = 8. Therefore, m+n = 9.; answer: 9\nCoT agent mw7x, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: The total number of ways to color the vertices is 256, as calculated in Sub-task 1. The number of valid colorings that allow for a rotation where all blue vertices can be placed in positions originally occupied by red vertices is 32, as determined in Sub-task 2.2. The probability of such a valid coloring is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of colorings, which is 32/256. Simplifying this fraction gives 1/8. Thus, the probability is 1/8, and since we need m+n where the probability is m/n, we have m=1 and n=8, so m+n=9.; answer: 9\nCoT agent hfgI, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: The total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon is 256, as each vertex can be red or blue. According to the sub-task 2.2, the number of valid colorings that allow for a rotation to match blue and red vertices is 32. The probability is the ratio of these valid colorings to the total colorings, which is 32/256. Simplifying this fraction gives 1/8. Therefore, the probability is 1/8, which is in the form m/n where m = 1 and n = 8. Thus, m + n = 1 + 8 = 9.; answer: 9\nCoT agent L9UW, on the purpose of calculating probability, thinking: We have the total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon, which is 256. We also have the number of distinct colorings that are invariant under rotation, which is 32. The probability that a valid rotation exists is the ratio of these two numbers. Therefore, the probability is 32/256, which simplifies to 1/8. The problem states that this probability is \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime.

The octagon has 8 rotational symmetries (0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315 degrees). For each symmetry, we calculate the number of colorings that remain unchanged. For a rotation by 0 degrees (identity), all 256 colorings are fixed. For a rotation by 180 degrees, each pair of opposite vertices must be the same color, resulting in 2^4 = 16 fixed colorings. For a rotation by 90 or 270 degrees, the octagon can be divided into 4 groups of 2 vertices, each pair must be the same color, resulting in 2^2 = 4 fixed colorings. For a rotation by 45, 135, 225, or 315 degrees, the octagon can be divided into 8 pairs, each pair must be the same color, resulting in 2 fixed colorings.

In this problem, the group actions are the rotations of the octagon. We have calculated the number of fixed colorings for each rotation: 256 for 0 degrees, 16 for 180 degrees, 4 for 90 and 270 degrees, and 2 for 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees. Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we sum these fixed colorings and divide by the number of symmetries (8): (256 + 16 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2) / 8 = 32. This matches the result from Burnside&#39;s Lemma, verifying the calculations are correct.; answer: The calculations align with Burnside&#39;s Lemma, confirming the results.\nDebate agent IMnV, round 0, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The problem involves calculating the probability that a colored octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices align with positions that were originally red. Using Burnside&#39;s Lemma, we determined there are 32 distinct colorings. Since each vertex is colored independently with two choices (red or blue), there are 2^8 = 256 total colorings. The probability is thus the ratio of these two numbers: 32/256, which simplifies to 1/8. Therefore, m = 1 and n = 8, making m+n = 9.; answer: 9\nDebate agent gScy, round 0, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The problem involves calculating the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in positions that were originally red. We verified using Burnside&#39;s Lemma that there are 32 distinct colorings. The total number of ways to color the octagon is 2^8 = 256. Therefore, the probability is 32/256 = 1/8. Simplifying the fraction gives m = 1 and n = 8, which are relatively prime. Thus, m + n = 1 + 8 = 9.; answer: 9\nDebate agent IMnV, round 1, on the purpose of simplifying probability, thinking: The task is to simplify the probability fraction to find m and n, and then calculate m+n. We have already determined from Burnside&#39;s Lemma that there are 32 distinct colorings and 256 total colorings, leading to a probability of 32/256.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#34;The sub-tasks show that Sub-task 2.1 is marked with &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that the task is too complex for the current block. The suggestion is to review the fixed coloring calculations for each rotation to ensure they align with the symmetry requirements and that the division by 8 yields an integer. This suggests that the task decomposition is not yet optimal, and the architecture might not be fully leveraging the blocks&#39; capabilities.&#34;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks include most of the necessary information from the original query, but there seems to be a disconnect in ensuring that all rotational symmetries and constraints are considered. The breakdown of symmetries needs to be more detailed to ensure completeness.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score remains at 0%, indicating an incorrect final response. This is primarily due to the issues in Sub-task 2.1. Addressing this decomposition will improve the final response.&#39;}

thought: {&#39;Further Decomposion&#39;: &#34;Last Sub-task 2.1 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 2.1.1, New Sub-task 2.1.2. Sub-task 2.1.1 will focus on recalculating the number of fixed colorings for each rotation by considering the detailed symmetry constraints. Sub-task 2.1.2 will verify the results and ensure they align with Burnside&#39;s Lemma, guaranteeing the division by 8 yields an integer. This decomposition aims to make the task more manageable by addressing potential errors in assumptions or calculations and ensuring all necessary details are considered.&#34;, &#39;Improved subtask architecture&#39;: &#39;Last Sub-task Architecture (CoT + Reflexion) (aims to address Sub-task 2.1) -&gt; (improve to) New Sub-task Architecture (CoT + Reflexion + LLM Debate). The new architecture will use CoT to provide a detailed breakdown of symmetries, Reflexion to verify the counting of valid colorings, and LLM Debate to discuss and refine the understanding of symmetry constraints. This approach leverages diverse perspectives and iterative refinement to handle complex calculations and assumptions.&#39;, &#39;Updated Subtask Instruction&#39;: &#39;It is known that 73, 65, 17, 163, 295, 147, and 1/8 are not correct.
