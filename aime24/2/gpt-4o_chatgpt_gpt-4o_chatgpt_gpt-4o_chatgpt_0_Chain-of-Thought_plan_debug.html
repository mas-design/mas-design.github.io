    <pre>Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>We need to count the number of ways to color the vertices of a regular octagon such that the octagon can be rotated to map blue vertices to where red vertices were. Each vertex is colored independently red or blue with equal probability, meaning there are 2^8 total colorings. We want the coloring to be symmetric under some rotation of the octagon. Think of the octagon as having vertices labeled 0 to 7. A rotation by k positions, where 0 &lt;= k &lt; 8, maps vertex i to vertex (i+k) mod 8. We must count the number of colorings invariant under this rotation. By Burnside&#39;s Lemma, the number of such colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by each rotation. The identity rotation fixes all 2^8 colorings. A rotation by k positions (k != 0) fixes a coloring only if all vertices are the same color, which gives 2 colorings (all red or all blue). There are 7 such non-identity rotations. By Burnside&#39;s Lemma, the average number of fixed colorings is (2^8 + 7*2) / 8 = 36. The probability is then 36 / 256 = 9 / 64. Therefore, m = 9 and n = 64, so m+n = 73.
