    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to count the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. A path from (0,0) to (8,8) on an 8x8 grid consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. Changing direction means switching between R and U. A path that changes direction exactly four times will have five segments, each consisting of consecutive R&#39;s or U&#39;s. Let&#39;s denote these segments as S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5. There are two possible patterns for these segments: R-U-R-U-R or U-R-U-R-U (starting with R or U). For the R-U-R-U-R pattern, the segments must satisfy L1 + L3 + L5 = 8 (total number of R&#39;s) and L2 + L4 = 8 (total number of U&#39;s). For the U-R-U-R-U pattern, the segments must satisfy L1 + L3 + L5 = 8 (total number of U&#39;s) and L2 + L4 = 8 (total number of R&#39;s). In both cases, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to these equations, which are classic partition problems. Using the stars and bars method, we find the number of solutions for each pattern and sum them to get the total number of paths.
