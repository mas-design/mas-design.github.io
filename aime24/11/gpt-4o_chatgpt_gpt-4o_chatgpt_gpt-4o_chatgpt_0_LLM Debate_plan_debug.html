    <pre>Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

### thinking by Debate Agent JS8Q:
To solve the problem, we need paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly 4 times, resulting in 5 segments. We have two cases: 3 horizontal and 2 vertical segments, or 2 horizontal and 3 vertical segments. For 3 horizontal segments, the equations are H1 + H2 + H3 = 8 and V1 + V2 = 8, where each Hi and Vi &gt;= 1. Using stars and bars, the number of solutions for H is C(7,2) = 21 and for V is C(7,1) = 7, giving 21 * 7 = 147 paths. For 2 horizontal and 3 vertical segments, the equations are H1 + H2 = 8 and V1 + V2 + V3 = 8. The number of solutions for H is C(7,1) = 7 and for V is C(7,2) = 21, giving 7 * 21 = 147 paths. Summing both cases gives 147 + 147 = 294 paths.

### thinking by Debate Agent xFvl:
To solve the problem of finding paths with exactly four direction changes on an 8x8 grid, we need to consider paths as sequences of horizontal and vertical moves. Each path consists of 8 horizontal and 8 vertical moves, totaling 16 moves. Changing direction four times means the path is divided into 5 segments. We consider two cases: 3 horizontal and 2 vertical segments, or 2 horizontal and 3 vertical segments. For the first case (3H, 2V), we solve H1 + H2 + H3 = 8 and V1 + V2 = 8 with each Hi, Vi &gt;= 1. The number of solutions for H is C(7,2) = 21 and for V is C(7,1) = 7. For the second case (2H, 3V), we solve H1 + H2 = 8 and V1 + V2 + V3 = 8. The number of solutions for H is C(7,1) = 7 and for V is C(7,2) = 21. We multiply the solutions for each case and add them to find the total number of paths.
