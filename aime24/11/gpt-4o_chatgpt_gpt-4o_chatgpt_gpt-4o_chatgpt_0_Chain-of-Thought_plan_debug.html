    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner that change direction exactly four times. A path from (0,0) to (8,8) consists of exactly 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. Changing direction corresponds to switching from R to U or U to R.

To have exactly four changes in direction, we can have a sequence like R^a U^b R^c U^d R^e, where a, b, c, d, e are positive integers and a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8. This corresponds to having two blocks of R&#39;s and two blocks of U&#39;s, with changes at the transitions.

Let&#39;s consider the arrangement:
1. R^a, U^b, R^c, U^d, R^e

The changes occur at:
- End of R^a to start of U^b
- End of U^b to start of R^c
- End of R^c to start of U^d
- End of U^d to start of R^e

We have the following constraints:
a + c + e = 8
b + d = 8

We need to count the number of positive integer solutions to these equations.

For a + c + e = 8, the number of positive solutions is the number of ways to put 2 dividers among the 7 remaining places (since each of a, c, e must be at least 1), which is C(7, 2).

For b + d = 8, the number of positive solutions is the number of ways to put 1 divider among the 7 remaining places (since each of b, d must be at least 1), which is C(7, 1).

Therefore, the total number of such paths is C(7, 2) * C(7, 1).
