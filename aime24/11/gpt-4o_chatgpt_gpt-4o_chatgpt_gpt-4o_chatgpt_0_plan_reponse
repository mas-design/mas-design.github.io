A path from (0,0) to (8,8) on an 8x8 grid consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. Changing direction means switching between R and U. A path that changes direction exactly four times will have five segments, each consisting of consecutive R's or U's. Let's denote these segments as S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5. There are two possible patterns for these segments: R-U-R-U-R or U-R-U-R-U (starting with R or U). For the R-U-R-U-R pattern, the segments must satisfy L1 + L3 + L5 = 8 (total number of R's) and L2 + L4 = 8 (total number of U's). For the U-R-U-R-U pattern, the segments must satisfy L1 + L3 + L5 = 8 (total number of U's) and L2 + L4 = 8 (total number of R's).
