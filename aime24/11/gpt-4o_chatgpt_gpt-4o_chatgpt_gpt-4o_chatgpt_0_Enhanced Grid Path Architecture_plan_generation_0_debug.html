    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

    <pre>thought: To solve the problem of finding the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we need to decompose the task into manageable sub-tasks that can be addressed by the existing architectures in the archive. The problem involves combinatorial reasoning and path counting, which can be complex if approached directly. By breaking it down into smaller sub-tasks, we can leverage the strengths of different architectures to solve each part effectively.

**Decomposition:**
1. **Sub-task 1:** Determine the possible configurations of direction changes within a path of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. This involves identifying how the path can be split into segments of horizontal and vertical movements such that there are exactly four changes in direction.
2. **Sub-task 2:** Based on the configurations from Sub-task 1, calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration. This involves combinatorial calculations to determine the number of ways to arrange the segments on the grid.
3. **Sub-task 3:** Aggregate the results from Sub-task 2 to find the total number of paths that meet the criteria specified in the problem.

By decomposing the task in this manner, each sub-task becomes more straightforward and can be addressed by a specific agent or combination of agents from the archive.

**Overall Architecture:**
To address each sub-task, we can design a multi-layered architecture using the existing blocks:
- **Layer 1:** Use the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) block to handle Sub-task 1, as it involves step-by-step reasoning to determine the possible configurations of direction changes.
- **Layer 2:** Employ the Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SC) block for Sub-task 2, as it requires combinatorial calculations and can benefit from multiple reasoning paths to ensure accuracy.
- **Layer 3:** Utilize the Reflexion block to handle Sub-task 3, as it involves aggregating results and refining the final count of valid paths.

**Implementation:**
1. Implement the CoT block to determine the configurations of direction changes for Sub-task 1.
2. Connect the output of CoT to CoT-SC to calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration in Sub-task 2.
3. Pass the results from CoT-SC to Reflexion to aggregate and refine the final count of valid paths in Sub-task 3.

By following this approach, we can effectively solve the problem by leveraging the strengths of each block in the archive.

A change occurs when an R is followed by a U or vice versa. With 4 changes, we can have configurations like RRUUUUUURRRRRRRR or UURRRRRRRUUUUUUU, which correspond to sequences like (2, 6) and (6, 2) respectively. For each configuration, we need to count the number of ways to arrange the R&#39;s and U&#39;s. For example, for the configuration (2, 6), we choose 2 R&#39;s from 8 positions and 6 U&#39;s from 8 positions, and vice versa. We need to calculate this for all configurations that result in exactly 4 changes.; answer: 3920\nCoT-SC agent I0Q8, on the purpose of calculating valid paths, thinking: To calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes, we need to determine how many ways we can arrange the R&#39;s and U&#39;s to achieve exactly 4 changes. Each configuration corresponds to a specific pattern of blocks of R&#39;s and U&#39;s. For example, one possible configuration is RRUUUUUURRRRRRRR, which consists of 2 R&#39;s, followed by 6 U&#39;s, followed by 6 R&#39;s. We need to calculate the number of ways to choose these blocks such that the total number of R&#39;s is 8 and the total number of U&#39;s is 8. This involves combinatorial counting of these blocks.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Enumerate all possible block patterns with exactly 4 changes and calculate the number of valid paths for each pattern using combinations. Consider patterns like (k1, k2, k3, k4, k5) where ki are the lengths of consecutive R or U blocks.\nCoT-SC agent QEEJ, on the purpose of calculating valid paths, thinking: We need to count the number of paths with exactly 4 direction changes. Each path is a sequence of 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s. A change in direction occurs when the sequence switches from R to U or from U to R. To have exactly 4 changes, we can have configurations like RRUUUUUURRRRRRRR (2 R&#39;s, 6 U&#39;s, 6 R&#39;s), UURRRRRRRUUUUUUU (2 U&#39;s, 6 R&#39;s, 6 U&#39;s), and so on. For each configuration, we can compute the number of paths by choosing positions for the blocks of R&#39;s and U&#39;s. For example, for RRUUUUUURRRRRRRR, we choose 2 positions for R&#39;s in the first block out of 8, then 6 positions for U&#39;s, etc.; answer: 2800\nCoT-SC agent IBSX, on the purpose of calculating valid paths, thinking: To calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes, we need to count the number of ways to arrange the blocks of R&#39;s and U&#39;s that result in exactly 4 changes. Each configuration consists of alternating blocks of R&#39;s and U&#39;s. For example, a configuration like RRUUUUUURRRRRRRR involves choosing how many R&#39;s and U&#39;s are in each block. We need to ensure that the total number of R&#39;s is 8 and the total number of U&#39;s is 8. This is a combinatorial problem involving partitioning the numbers 8 into parts that correspond to the lengths of these blocks. The key is to find the number of ways to partition 8 into 5 parts (since 4 changes mean 5 blocks) with alternating R and U, ensuring each part is at least 1. After determining the partitions, we calculate the number of ways to assign R&#39;s and U&#39;s to these partitions, considering symmetry and alternation.; answer: 420\nReflexion CoT agent MIQR, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: The problem involves counting paths on a grid with specific direction changes.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;The sub-task 2 answer contains &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that the task is too difficult for the block to handle. The suggestion provided after &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; is to enumerate all possible block patterns with exactly 4 changes and calculate the number of valid paths for each pattern using combinations. This suggests that the decomposition issue (a) is the primary problem. The sub-task needs further decomposition to make it more manageable for the blocks.&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks cover the necessary information, but the connection between sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 is not strong enough to ensure that all configurations are considered in a detailed manner. The current decomposition is missing a step to enumerate all possible block patterns.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score is low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The final response suggests that the problem is not fully addressed by the current decomposition and block connection. The architecture needs to be revised to improve the final response.&#39;}

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to further decompose the tasks and improve the sub-task architecture.

**Further Decomposition:**
1. Last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1.1, new sub-task 1.2
   - **New Sub-task 1.1:** Enumerate all possible block patterns of R and U with exactly four changes. This sub-task focuses on identifying all possible sequences of R&#39;s and U&#39;s that result in four changes.
   - **New Sub-task 1.2:** Calculate the number of valid paths for each block pattern using combinatorial methods. This sub-task will focus on calculating the number of ways to arrange the blocks on the grid.

Justification: The new sub-tasks are more specific and break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. By enumerating all possible block patterns first, we ensure that no possible configurations are missed. Then, by calculating the number of valid paths for each pattern, we ensure that the combinatorial aspect is addressed in detail.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
1. Last sub-task architecture (COT-SC) (aims to address sub-task 2) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (COT -&gt; Reflexion)
   - By using Reflexion after COT, we can refine the results of the combinatorial calculations and ensure that the final count is accurate.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
- It is known that 560 is not correct. This should be added to the last sub-task to avoid incorrect answers being repeated.
