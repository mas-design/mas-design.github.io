    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.

    <pre>thought: To solve the problem of finding the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we need to decompose the task into manageable sub-tasks that can be addressed by the existing architectures in the archive. The problem involves combinatorial reasoning and path counting, which can be complex if approached directly. By breaking it down into smaller sub-tasks, we can leverage the strengths of different architectures to solve each part effectively.

**Decomposition:**
1. **Sub-task 1:** Determine the possible configurations of direction changes within a path of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. This involves identifying how the path can be split into segments of horizontal and vertical movements such that there are exactly four changes in direction.
2. **Sub-task 2:** Based on the configurations from Sub-task 1, calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration. This involves combinatorial calculations to determine the number of ways to arrange the segments on the grid.
3. **Sub-task 3:** Aggregate the results from Sub-task 2 to find the total number of paths that meet the criteria specified in the problem.

By decomposing the task in this manner, each sub-task becomes more straightforward and can be addressed by a specific agent or combination of agents from the archive.

**Overall Architecture:**
To address each sub-task, we can design a multi-layered architecture using the existing blocks:
- **Layer 1:** Use the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) block to handle Sub-task 1, as it involves step-by-step reasoning to determine the possible configurations of direction changes.
- **Layer 2:** Employ the Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SC) block for Sub-task 2, as it requires combinatorial calculations and can benefit from multiple reasoning paths to ensure accuracy.
- **Layer 3:** Utilize the Reflexion block to handle Sub-task 3, as it involves aggregating results and refining the final count of valid paths.

**Implementation:**
1. Implement the CoT block to determine the configurations of direction changes for Sub-task 1.
2. Connect the output of CoT to CoT-SC to calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration in Sub-task 2.
3. Pass the results from CoT-SC to Reflexion to aggregate and refine the final count of valid paths in Sub-task 3.

By following this approach, we can effectively solve the problem by leveraging the strengths of each block in the archive.

To have exactly 4 direction changes, we can consider various sequences of R&#39;s and U&#39;s that result in exactly 4 changes.

A change occurs when an R is followed by a U or vice versa. With 4 changes, we can have configurations like RRUUUUUURRRRRRRR or UURRRRRRRUUUUUUU, which correspond to sequences like (2, 6) and (6, 2) respectively. For each configuration, we need to count the number of ways to arrange the R&#39;s and U&#39;s. For example, for the configuration (2, 6), we choose 2 R&#39;s from 8 positions and 6 U&#39;s from 8 positions, and vice versa. We need to calculate this for all configurations that result in exactly 4 changes.; answer: 3920\nCoT-SC agent I0Q8, on the purpose of calculating valid paths, thinking: To calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes, we need to determine how many ways we can arrange the R&#39;s and U&#39;s to achieve exactly 4 changes. Each configuration corresponds to a specific pattern of blocks of R&#39;s and U&#39;s. For example, one possible configuration is RRUUUUUURRRRRRRR, which consists of 2 R&#39;s, followed by 6 U&#39;s, followed by 6 R&#39;s. We need to calculate the number of ways to choose these blocks such that the total number of R&#39;s is 8 and the total number of U&#39;s is 8. This involves combinatorial counting of these blocks.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Enumerate all possible block patterns with exactly 4 changes and calculate the number of valid paths for each pattern using combinations. Consider patterns like (k1, k2, k3, k4, k5) where ki are the lengths of consecutive R or U blocks.\nCoT-SC agent QEEJ, on the purpose of calculating valid paths, thinking: We need to count the number of paths with exactly 4 direction changes. Each path is a sequence of 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s. A change in direction occurs when the sequence switches from R to U or from U to R. To have exactly 4 changes, we can have configurations like RRUUUUUURRRRRRRR (2 R&#39;s, 6 U&#39;s, 6 R&#39;s), UURRRRRRRUUUUUUU (2 U&#39;s, 6 R&#39;s, 6 U&#39;s), and so on. For each configuration, we can compute the number of paths by choosing positions for the blocks of R&#39;s and U&#39;s. For example, for RRUUUUUURRRRRRRR, we choose 2 positions for R&#39;s in the first block out of 8, then 6 positions for U&#39;s, etc.; answer: 2800\nCoT-SC agent IBSX, on the purpose of calculating valid paths, thinking: To calculate the number of valid paths for each configuration of direction changes, we need to count the number of ways to arrange the blocks of R&#39;s and U&#39;s that result in exactly 4 changes. Each configuration consists of alternating blocks of R&#39;s and U&#39;s. For example, a configuration like RRUUUUUURRRRRRRR involves choosing how many R&#39;s and U&#39;s are in each block. We need to ensure that the total number of R&#39;s is 8 and the total number of U&#39;s is 8. This is a combinatorial problem involving partitioning the numbers 8 into parts that correspond to the lengths of these blocks. The key is to find the number of ways to partition 8 into 5 parts (since 4 changes mean 5 blocks) with alternating R and U, ensuring each part is at least 1. After determining the partitions, we calculate the number of ways to assign R&#39;s and U&#39;s to these partitions, considering symmetry and alternation.; answer: 420\nReflexion CoT agent MIQR, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: The problem involves counting paths on a grid with specific direction changes.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;The sub-task 2 answer contains &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that the task is too difficult for the block to handle. The suggestion provided after &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; is to enumerate all possible block patterns with exactly 4 changes and calculate the number of valid paths for each pattern using combinations. This suggests that the decomposition issue (a) is the primary problem. The sub-task needs further decomposition to make it more manageable for the blocks.&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks cover the necessary information, but the connection between sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 is not strong enough to ensure that all configurations are considered in a detailed manner.

The final response suggests that the problem is not fully addressed by the current decomposition and block connection. The architecture needs to be revised to improve the final response.&#39;}

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to further decompose the tasks and improve the sub-task architecture.

**Further Decomposition:**
1. Last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1.1, new sub-task 1.2
   - **New Sub-task 1.1:** Enumerate all possible block patterns of R and U with exactly four changes. This sub-task focuses on identifying all possible sequences of R&#39;s and U&#39;s that result in four changes.
   - **New Sub-task 1.2:** Calculate the number of valid paths for each block pattern using combinatorial methods. This sub-task will focus on calculating the number of ways to arrange the blocks on the grid.

Justification: The new sub-tasks are more specific and break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. By enumerating all possible block patterns first, we ensure that no possible configurations are missed. Then, by calculating the number of valid paths for each pattern, we ensure that the combinatorial aspect is addressed in detail.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
1. Last sub-task architecture (COT-SC) (aims to address sub-task 2) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (COT -&gt; Reflexion)
   - By using Reflexion after COT, we can refine the results of the combinatorial calculations and ensure that the final count is accurate.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
- It is known that 560 is not correct. This should be added to the last sub-task to avoid incorrect answers being repeated.

A change in direction occurs when a sequence of R&#39;s is followed by a sequence of U&#39;s or vice versa. With exactly four changes, there are five blocks of R&#39;s and U&#39;s.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#34;Sub-task 1.1 still contains &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating a need for further decomposition. The suggestion is to enumerate the number of ways to distribute 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s into these block patterns, which implies that the task is still too complex for the current block. Sub-task 1.2 has an incorrect result, suggesting that the task may be too difficult for the block or the block&#39;s settings are not optimal.

The architecture and task decomposition need to be revised to improve the final response.&#39;}

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to further decompose the tasks and improve the sub-task architecture.

**Further Decomposition:**
1. Last sub-task 1.1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1.1.1, new sub-task 1.1.2
   - **New Sub-task 1.1.1:** Enumerate all possible block patterns of R and U with exactly four changes, considering different starting directions (R or U).
   - **New Sub-task 1.1.2:** Calculate the number of ways to distribute 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s into each block pattern using combinatorial methods.

Justification: The new sub-tasks are more specific and break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. By considering different starting directions and enumerating all possible block patterns first, we ensure that no possible configurations are missed. Then, by calculating the number of ways to distribute R&#39;s and U&#39;s, we ensure that the combinatorial aspect is addressed in detail.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
1. Last sub-task architecture (COT -&gt; Reflexion) (aims to address sub-task 1.2) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (COT-SC -&gt; Reflexion)
   - By using Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought (COT-SC) before Reflexion, we can ensure varied reasoning paths are considered, improving the accuracy of the combinatorial calculations.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
- It is known that 810, 560, 294, 630, 70, and 1470 are not correct. This should be added to the last sub-task to avoid incorrect answers being repeated.

A change of direction occurs when a move changes from R to U or from U to R. Each path must have exactly 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s, as we are going from (0,0) to (8,8) on the grid. If we start with R, the sequence must have the form R^a U^b R^c U^d R^e, where a, b, c, d, e are positive integers and a + c + e = 8, b + d = 8. Similarly, if we start with U, the sequence would be U^a R^b U^c R^d U^e, with a + c + e = 8, b + d = 8. We need to enumerate all such sequences.; answer - Starting with R: R^a U^b R^c U^d R^e with a + c + e = 8, b + d = 8.

For each pattern, we use combinations to determine how to assign numbers to each segment such that the total number of R&#39;s and U&#39;s is 8, respectively. For instance, starting with R, the pattern is R^a U^b R^c U^d R^e, where a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8. We choose a, c, e such that they sum to 8, and b, d such that they sum to 8, using combinations. The same logic applies to patterns starting with U.; answer - Starting with R: Choose a, c, e such that a + c + e = 8, which is \\( \\binom{8+2}{2} = 45 \\) ways. Choose b, d such that b + d = 8, which is \\( \\binom{8+1}{1} = 9 \\) ways. This gives 45 * 9 = 405 ways.

Previous attempts have resulted in incorrect answers, indicating potential errors in logic or missing constraints. The task requires careful consideration of path configurations and combinatorial calculations. It&#39;s possible that the calculations of combinations or specific configurations of paths with exactly four changes were not fully considered. Given the complexity and previous incorrect results, there might be additional constraints or specific path patterns that need to be considered, making it challenging to determine the correct number without more detailed breakdowns or additional information.; answer - 300\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Review the specific configurations and constraints for paths with exactly four direction changes, and ensure all possible patterns are accounted for.&#34;]

We have two cases: starting with R and starting with U. For each case, we have sequences like R^a U^b R^c U^d R^e and U^a R^b U^c R^d U^e, where the sums of the exponents are fixed. We can use the stars and bars method to determine the number of ways to partition the total number of R&#39;s and U&#39;s into the given blocks. For example, starting with R, we solve for the number of solutions to a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8, where a, b, c, d, e are positive integers. The number of solutions is given by the combinatorial formula C(n-1, k-1) where n is the total and k is the number of parts. We compute this for both starting cases and sum the results.; answer: 4900\nCoT-SC agent Y4YO, on the purpose of calculating distributions, thinking: We need to count the number of ways to distribute 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s into the block patterns identified in sub-task 1.1.1. For each pattern, we use the multinomial coefficient to count the number of ways to partition the R&#39;s and U&#39;s among the blocks. Starting with R, the pattern is R^a U^b R^c U^d R^e with a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8. The number of ways to choose a, c, and e is given by the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + c + e = 8, which is \\( \\binom{10}{2} \\). Similarly, the number of ways to choose b and d is \\( \\binom{9}{1} \\). For the pattern starting with U, U^a R^b U^c R^d U^e with a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8, the calculations are the same. Therefore, the total number of ways is 2 * \\( \\binom{10}{2} \\) * \\( \\binom{9}{1} \\).; answer: 810\nCoT-SC agent EMk0, on the purpose of calculating distributions, thinking: We have two cases to consider: starting with R and starting with U. For each case, we need to distribute the R&#39;s and U&#39;s into the specified block pattern. Starting with R: R^a U^b R^c U^d R^e, with a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8. We can think of this as distributing 8 R&#39;s into 3 blocks (a, c, e) and 8 U&#39;s into 2 blocks (b, d). The number of ways to do this is given by the stars and bars method: (7 choose 2) for the R&#39;s and (7 choose 1) for the U&#39;s. Similarly, starting with U: U^a R^b U^c R^d U^e, with a + c + e = 8 and b + d = 8. Again, using stars and bars, we have (7 choose 2) for the U&#39;s and (7 choose 1) for the R&#39;s. We sum the results for both cases.; answer: 784\nReflexion CoT agent mAtk, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: We need to calculate the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times on an 8x8 grid. The sub-task 1.1.2 provides the number of ways to distribute R&#39;s and U&#39;s for each block pattern. We add the results for paths starting with R and paths starting with U, which are both 405. Therefore, the total number of paths is 405 + 405 = 810. However, the prompt indicates that 810 is not correct, suggesting there might be an error or additional considerations needed.; answer: 810\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Review the reasoning for counting paths and verify if there are other constraints or corrections needed, as 810 is listed as incorrect.\nReflexion Critic agent wy4X, on the purpose of verifying results, thinking: The problem involves counting paths on an 8x8 grid with exactly four direction changes. The previous attempt calculated 810 paths, but this was marked incorrect along with other numbers.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;Sub-task 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 are solvable but still lead to incorrect results, indicating that the decomposition might not be detailed enough. Sub-task 1.2 contains &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, suggesting further decomposition is needed. The block architecture used might not be optimal for handling the complexity of these tasks, indicating a need for both (a) further decomposition and (b) an improved block architecture.&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks include necessary information from the original query, but the execution does not effectively yield a comprehensive answer. The connection between sub-tasks needs to be clearer to ensure that the results are correctly aggregated.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The architecture and task decomposition need to be revised to improve the final response.&#39;}

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to further decompose the tasks and improve the sub-task architecture.

**Further Decomposition:**
1. Last sub-task 1.1.1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1.1.1.1, new sub-task 1.1.1.2
   - **New Sub-task 1.1.1.1:** Identify distinct sequences of R and U that result in exactly four changes, considering different starting directions and ensuring all patterns are accounted for.
   - **New Sub-task 1.1.1.2:** Calculate the number of ways to implement each sequence using combinatorial methods, ensuring all constraints are considered.

Justification: The new sub-tasks break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. By identifying distinct sequences first and then calculating the number of ways to implement these sequences, we ensure a comprehensive approach.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
1. Last sub-task architecture (COT-SC -&gt; Reflexion) (aims to address sub-task 1.2) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (COT -&gt; LLM Debate)
   - By using LLM Debate after COT, we can leverage diverse perspectives to refine and verify the combinatorial calculations, improving the accuracy of the results.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
- It is known that 810, 560, 294, 630, 70, 1470, and 300 are not correct. This should be added to the last sub-task to avoid incorrect answers being repeated.

Based on the previous sub-task, there are 70 distinct sequences that achieve this. Each sequence is a permutation of 8 &#39;R&#39;s and 8 &#39;U&#39;s, with specific patterns that ensure exactly four changes. We must count the valid permutations for each pattern using combinatorial methods. However, without specific details on the patterns, it is difficult to proceed with precise calculations. Therefore, further breakdown or additional information on these patterns is needed.; answer: 70\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide specific patterns or examples of sequences that result in exactly four changes, and calculate the number of permutations for each pattern using combinations.\nCoT-SC agent oUSx, on the purpose of calculating implementations, thinking: The problem involves finding the number of ways to implement sequences of R and U moves that change direction exactly four times. We know from the previous sub-task that there are 70 distinct sequences of R and U that result in exactly four changes. To calculate the number of ways to implement each sequence, we need to use combinatorial methods to determine how many ways we can arrange 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s in each sequence pattern. Each sequence pattern corresponds to a way of partitioning the 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s into blocks that switch direction exactly 4 times. This involves calculating combinatorial coefficients for each block size in the sequence patterns.; answer: There are 3432 ways to implement each sequence using combinatorial methods. This is calculated by considering the possible block sizes for each pattern and using combinations to determine the number of ways to arrange the R&#39;s and U&#39;s within those blocks.\nCoT-SC agent PGOO, on the purpose of calculating implementations, thinking: We need to calculate the number of ways to implement each sequence that results in exactly four changes of direction, given that there are 70 distinct sequences identified in sub-task 1.1.1.1. Each sequence can be realized by choosing the positions for &#39;R&#39; and &#39;U&#39; moves in the path. We have 8 &#39;R&#39; moves and 8 &#39;U&#39; moves in total, and we need to ensure that the sequence follows the pattern of changes identified. This involves combinatorial counting for each pattern. However, without the specific patterns or sequences identified, it&#39;s challenging to directly compute the number of implementations.; answer: 70\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide the specific patterns or sequences of &#39;R&#39; and &#39;U&#39; that result in exactly four changes, so that we can calculate the number of ways each sequence can be implemented using combinatorial methods.\nCoT-SC agent 2k04, on the purpose of calculating implementations, thinking: The task involves calculating the number of ways to implement each sequence of R and U moves that result in exactly four changes of direction on an 8x8 grid. Each sequence consists of 8 &#39;R&#39; and 8 &#39;U&#39; moves. A change of direction occurs when the sequence switches between &#39;R&#39; and &#39;U&#39;. We need to consider all possible patterns of these changes and count the valid permutations for each pattern. Since this involves combinatorial methods and potentially complex enumeration, the problem might be intricate without further breakdown or examples of patterns.; answer: 70\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide examples of specific patterns of direction changes and calculate the number of valid permutations for each pattern, possibly using binomial coefficients.\nDebate agent Etey, round 0, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: The task involves calculating the total number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. The paths consist of sequences of right (R) and up (U) moves. Each sequence must have exactly four changes in direction, which means alternating between R and U moves in a specific pattern. The problem requires identifying these sequences and calculating the number of ways each can be implemented using combinatorial methods. However, without a breakdown of each sequence pattern and the combinatorial calculations for each, it is challenging to aggregate the results accurately. The previously mentioned numbers are incorrect, indicating a complex combinatorial problem that requires detailed enumeration and calculation of each sequence pattern.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Decompose the problem by identifying distinct patterns of R and U sequences with exactly four changes in direction, and use combinatorial methods to calculate the number of permutations for each pattern. Ensure all patterns are considered and calculations are verified.\nDebate agent TLlo, round 0, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: The problem involves counting paths on a grid with specific constraints on direction changes, which is a complex combinatorial problem. The previous sub-tasks suggest breaking down the problem into smaller parts and using combinatorial methods to solve each part. However, the sub-task results mention numbers that are incorrect, indicating a possible calculation or conceptual error in previous steps. Without explicit breakdowns and calculations, it&#39;s difficult to aggregate the results accurately. The complexity arises from needing to calculate permutations for each pattern of R and U with four changes, which requires detailed enumeration and combinatorial analysis.; answer: 70\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Enumerate each pattern of R and U sequences with exactly four changes, apply combinatorial formulas to each, and ensure all constraints are considered to find the total number of paths.\nDebate agent Etey, round 1, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: The problem involves counting paths on an 8x8 grid with exactly four direction changes.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;Sub-task 1.1.1.1 and 1.1.1.2 both contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that further decomposition is needed. The suggestions indicate a need for breaking down each pattern of R and U sequences with four changes and using combinatorial counting to calculate the number of permutations for each pattern. This suggests a decomposition issue (a). Additionally, the use of the Debate architecture in sub-task 1.2 did not produce a correct result, suggesting a potential block and agent issue (b).&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks attempt to cover necessary information, but the execution does not effectively yield a comprehensive answer. The connection between sub-tasks needs to be clearer to ensure that the results are correctly aggregated.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The architecture and task decomposition need to be revised to improve the final response.&#39;}

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to further decompose the tasks and improve the sub-task architecture.

**Further Decomposition:**
1. Last sub-task 1.1.1.1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1.1.1.1.1, new sub-task 1.1.1.1.2
   - **New Sub-task 1.1.1.1.1:** Identify the distinct patterns of R and U sequences that result in exactly four changes, considering the constraints of the grid.
   - **New Sub-task 1.1.1.1.2:** For each identified pattern, calculate the number of permutations using combinatorial methods.

Justification: The new sub-tasks are more specific and break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. By identifying distinct patterns first and then calculating permutations for each pattern, we ensure a comprehensive approach.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
1. Last sub-task architecture (COT -&gt; LLM Debate) (aims to address sub-task 1.2) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (COT -&gt; Reflexion)
   - By using Reflexion after COT, we can refine the results and ensure accuracy in the combinatorial calculations.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
- It is known that 810, 560, 294, 630, 70, 1470, 300, and 350 are not correct. This should be added to the last sub-task to avoid incorrect answers being repeated.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1.1.1.1.1 output: thinking - To find the distinct patterns of R and U sequences that change direction exactly four times, we need to consider how the path can transition between horizontal (R) and vertical (U) directions four times. A path from (0,0) to (8,8) on an 8x8 grid must consist of exactly 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s. The simplest way to have exactly four changes in direction is to have five segments, alternating between R and U. Each change in direction occurs at the transition between segments. Therefore, we need to divide the sequence of 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s into five segments, with alternating directions, such as R-U-R-U-R or U-R-U-R-U. The exact distribution of R&#39;s and U&#39;s in each segment must sum to 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s in total.; answer - The distinct patterns of R and U sequences with exactly four direction changes are: RRRRUUUURRRRUUUU, RRRRUUUUUUUURRRR, RUUUURRRRUUUURRR, UUUURRRRUUUURRRR, UUUURRRRRUUUURRR, and UUUUUUUURRRRRRRR.\nSub-task 1.1.1.1.2 output: thinking - Each pattern consists of a specific number of R&#39;s and U&#39;s in each segment.

agents: [&#34;CoT agent 8Z4d, on the purpose of identifying patterns, thinking: To find the distinct patterns of R and U sequences that change direction exactly four times, we need to consider how the path can transition between horizontal (R) and vertical (U) directions four times.

We need to calculate the number of ways to arrange R&#39;s and U&#39;s within each segment for the given patterns. For example, for the pattern RRRRUUUURRRRUUUU, we have 4 R&#39;s, then 4 U&#39;s, then 4 R&#39;s, then 4 U&#39;s. The number of permutations of the entire sequence is given by the multinomial coefficient. We apply this method to each pattern.; answer: 70\n70\n560\n560\n70\n1\nCoT-SC agent T8lA, on the purpose of calculating permutations, thinking: To calculate the number of permutations for each identified pattern, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the R&#39;s and U&#39;s according to each pattern. Each pattern specifies a certain number of R&#39;s and U&#39;s in specific segments. For example, for the pattern RRRRUUUURRRRUUUU, there are four R&#39;s followed by four U&#39;s, then four R&#39;s followed by four U&#39;s. The number of permutations for each pattern is calculated using combinations, specifically choosing positions for R&#39;s or U&#39;s in the sequence. For the pattern RRRRUUUURRRRUUUU, we can choose 4 positions for the first set of R&#39;s out of 8, and the rest are determined, so it&#39;s 1 way. Similarly, for the pattern RRRRUUUUUUUURRRR, we choose 4 positions for the first set of R&#39;s, then 8 positions for U&#39;s, and the remaining 4 are R&#39;s, which is also 1 way. Each pattern has a fixed way of arranging R&#39;s and U&#39;s, so each pattern contributes exactly 1 way.; answer: 6\nCoT-SC agent Gprj, on the purpose of calculating permutations, thinking: We have distinct patterns of R and U sequences that change direction exactly four times. For each pattern, we need to calculate the number of permutations. Each pattern is a sequence of R&#39;s and U&#39;s with specific counts, and we can use combinatorial methods to count the number of ways to arrange these sequences. For example, the pattern RRRRUUUURRRRUUUU consists of 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s. The number of permutations of this pattern is given by the multinomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to arrange these letters. Similarly, we calculate for other patterns.; answer: 700\n700\n784\n784\n784\n70\nCoT-SC agent cCbC, on the purpose of calculating permutations, thinking: Each distinct pattern consists of sequences of R&#39;s and U&#39;s. For each pattern, we need to calculate the number of ways to arrange the R&#39;s and U&#39;s given the fixed segments. For example, for the pattern RRRRUUUURRRRUUUU, we have 4 R&#39;s followed by 4 U&#39;s, then 4 R&#39;s, and finally 4 U&#39;s. The number of permutations is determined by choosing the positions of R&#39;s and U&#39;s in each segment. Since each segment is distinct and non-overlapping, the number of permutations for each pattern is 1. This is because once we fix the pattern, there is only one way to arrange the R&#39;s and U&#39;s within the constraints of the pattern.; answer: 1\nCoT-SC agent FfAu, on the purpose of calculating permutations, thinking: Each pattern consists of a sequence of R&#39;s and U&#39;s that must add up to 8 R&#39;s and 8 U&#39;s. We can calculate the number of permutations for each pattern using combinations. For example, for the pattern RRRRUUUURRRRUUUU, we have 4 R&#39;s followed by 4 U&#39;s, followed by 4 R&#39;s, followed by 4 U&#39;s. The number of ways to arrange these within the sequence is given by the multinomial coefficient. Similarly, we calculate for each pattern identified.; answer: 70\n70\n560\n70\n560\n1\nReflexion CoT agent u2lt, on the purpose of aggregating results, thinking: The problem requires aggregating the results of paths that change direction exactly four times.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;Sub-task 1.1.1.1.2 contains &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that the task is too complex for the current block or requires further decomposition. Additionally, the Reflexion block used in sub-task 1.2 did not resolve the issue of incorrect aggregation, suggesting a block and agent issue (b).&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks attempt to cover necessary information, but the execution does not effectively yield a comprehensive answer.

The architecture and task decomposition need to be revised to improve the final response.&#39;}

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to further decompose the tasks and improve the sub-task architecture.

**Further Decomposition:**
1. Last sub-task 1.1.1.1.2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1.1.1.1.2.1, new sub-task 1.1.1.1.2.2
   - **New Sub-task 1.1.1.1.2.1:** Identify the specific combinatorial patterns for each sequence pattern identified in sub-task 1.1.1.1.1.
   - **New Sub-task 1.1.1.1.2.2:** Calculate the permutations for each identified pattern using detailed combinatorial methods.

Justification: The new sub-tasks break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. By identifying specific combinatorial patterns and then calculating permutations for each pattern, we ensure a comprehensive approach.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
1. Last sub-task architecture (COT -&gt; Reflexion) (aims to address sub-task 1.2) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (COT-SC -&gt; LLM Debate)
   - By using LLM Debate after COT-SC, we can leverage diverse perspectives to refine and verify the combinatorial calculations, improving the accuracy of the results.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
- It is known that 810, 560, 294, 630, 70, 1470, 300, 350, and 1331 are not correct. This should be added to the last sub-task to avoid incorrect answers being repeated.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;Sub-task 1.1.1.1.2.1 contains &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that the task is too complex for the current block and requires further decomposition. The suggestion is to break down the combinatorial patterns further. Additionally, the Debate block used in sub-task 1.2 did not resolve the issue of incorrect aggregation, suggesting a block and agent issue (b).&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks attempt to cover necessary information, but the execution does not effectively yield a comprehensive answer. The connection between sub-tasks needs to be clearer to ensure that the results are correctly aggregated.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The architecture and task decomposition need to be revised to improve the final response.&#39;}

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to further decompose the tasks and improve the sub-task architecture.

**Further Decomposition:**
1. Last sub-task 1.1.1.1.2.1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1.1.1.1.2.1.1, new sub-task 1.1.1.1.2.1.2
   - **New Sub-task 1.1.1.1.2.1.1:** Enumerate all possible valid partitions of the 16 steps into 5 segments with exactly 4 changes in direction.
   - **New Sub-task 1.1.1.1.2.1.2:** Calculate the number of permutations for each partition using detailed combinatorial methods.

Justification: The new sub-tasks break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. By enumerating all valid partitions first and then calculating permutations for each partition, we ensure a comprehensive approach.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
1. Last sub-task architecture (COT-SC -&gt; LLM Debate) (aims to address sub-task 1.2) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (COT-SC -&gt; Reflexion)
   - By using Reflexion after COT-SC, we can refine the results and ensure accuracy in the combinatorial calculations.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
- It is known that 810, 560, 294, 630, 70, 1470, 300, 350, 1331, and 19600 are not correct. This should be added to the last sub-task to avoid incorrect answers being repeated.
