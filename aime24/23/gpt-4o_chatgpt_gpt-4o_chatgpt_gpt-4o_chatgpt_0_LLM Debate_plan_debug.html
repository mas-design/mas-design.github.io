    <pre>Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

### thinking by Debate Agent Hr6w:
We need to determine the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the rows left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the columns top to bottom is 99. Let&#39;s define the grid as follows: \[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a &amp; b &amp; c \\ \hline d &amp; e &amp; f \\ \hline \end{array} \] The conditions translate to: 1. \( (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999 \) 2. \( (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 99 \). We can express the sum of the digits in terms of the columns as \( a + d = x, \ b + e = y, \ c + f = z \). Therefore, \( x + y + z = 99 \). Substituting these into the first condition gives \( 100x + 10y + z = 999 \). We have a system of two equations: \( x + y + z = 99 \) and \( 100x + 10y + z = 999 \). Solving these, we eliminate \( z \) to get \( 99x + 9y = 900 \), simplifying to \( 11x + y = 100 \). From \( x + y + z = 99 \), we find \( z = 10x - 1 \). All variables \( x, y, z \) must be non-negative integers. For \( x = 9 \), \( y = 100 - 11 \times 9 = 1 \) and \( z = 10 \times 9 - 1 = 89 \). This is valid since \( x, y, z \) are digits (0-9), and they satisfy both equations. For other values of \( x \), either \( y \) or \( z \) becomes negative or exceeds the digit range. Thus, the only possible configuration is when \( x = 9, y = 1, z = 89 \). To find the number of ways to arrange this configuration, observe that the digits in the columns must sum as follows: - First column: \( a + d = 9 \) - Second column: \( b + e = 1 \) - Third column: \( c + f = 89 \). For the third column, since the sum \( c + f = 89 \) must be composed of digits, the only possibility is \( c = 8, f = 1 \). For the second column, \( b + e = 1 \) can be \( b = 0, e = 1 \) or \( b = 1, e = 0 \). For the first column, \( a + d = 9 \) can be any of the following pairs: \( (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0) \). Thus, there are 2 choices for the second column and 10 choices for the first column. The total number of ways is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \).

Solving these equations, we can eliminate \( z \) by subtracting the first from the second: \( 99x + 9y = 900 \). Simplifying, we get: \( 11x + y = 100 \). From the first equation, \( y = 100 - 11x \). Substitute \( y \) in the second equation: \( x + (100 - 11x) + z = 99 \), \( x + 100 - 11x + z = 99 \), \( -10x + z = -1 \), \( z = 10x - 1 \). All variables \( x, y, z \) must be non-negative integers. For \( x = 9 \): \( y = 100 - 11 \times 9 = 1 \) and \( z = 10 \times 9 - 1 = 89 \).
