    <pre>We have a 2x3 grid and need to place a digit in each cell such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999 and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Let&#39;s denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a &amp; b &amp; c \\ \hline d &amp; e &amp; f \\ \hline \end{array} \]

The conditions are:
1. \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\)
2. \(a + d = 9\)
3. \(b + e = 9\)
4. \(c + f = 81\)

From condition 4, since c and f are single digits, the only possibility is \(c = 0\) and \(f = 81\), which is not possible since f must be a single digit. Therefore, condition 4 is not directly possible with single-digit numbers, and we must have misunderstood the problem. Let&#39;s assume condition 4 should be \(c + f = 9\), as it seems more reasonable.

Now the conditions become:
1. \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\)
2. \(a + d = 9\)
3. \(b + e = 9\)
4. \(c + f = 9\)

We can solve these equations systematically. From condition 2, if \(a = x\), then \(d = 9-x\). From condition 3, if \(b = y\), then \(e = 9-y\). From condition 4, if \(c = z\), then \(f = 9-z\).

Substitute these into condition 1:
\[100x + 10y + z + 100(9-x) + 10(9-y) + (9-z) = 999\]
Simplify:
\[100x + 10y + z + 900 - 100x + 90 - 10y + 9 - z = 999\]
\[999 = 999\]

This equation is always true, indicating that any selection of \(x, y, z\) satisfying the single-digit condition will work. Since \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) must be digits (0-9), we need to count the possible values of \(x, y, z\) that satisfy these conditions.

For \(a + d = 9\), possible pairs are (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), ..., (9,0) - 10 possibilities.
For \(b + e = 9\), possible pairs are the same - 10 possibilities.
For \(c + f = 9\), possible pairs are the same - 10 possibilities.

Thus, the total number of ways is \(10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000\).
