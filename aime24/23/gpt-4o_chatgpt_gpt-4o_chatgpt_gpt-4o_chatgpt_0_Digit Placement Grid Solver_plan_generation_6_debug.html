    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\ \hline 9 &amp; 9 &amp; 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

    **Decomposition:**
    To solve the given problem, we need to decompose it into simpler sub-tasks that can be addressed by the existing blocks in the archive. The problem involves placing digits in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

    Sub-task 1: Identify all possible combinations of digits for the top row of the grid that form a three-digit number.
    Sub-task 2: Identify all possible combinations of digits for the bottom row of the grid that form a three-digit number.
    Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, find combinations where the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999.
    Sub-task 4: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, find combinations where the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.
    Sub-task 5: Based on the outputs from sub-task 3 and 4, identify the common combinations that satisfy both conditions.

    This decomposition breaks down the complex problem into manageable parts that can be handled by the existing blocks. By solving these sub-tasks, we can systematically find the solution to the original problem.

    **Overall Architecture:**
    To solve each sub-task, we will use the following architecture:
    - Sub-task 1 and 2 will be addressed using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) block to generate possible combinations of digits for the rows.
    - Sub-task 3 and 4 will use the Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SC) block to verify the sums for each set of combinations.
    - Sub-task 5 will use the LLM Debate block to identify the common combinations that satisfy both conditions.

    **Implementation:**
    1. Use the CoT block to solve sub-task 1 and 2 by generating possible digit combinations for the top and bottom rows of the grid.
    2. Use the CoT-SC block to verify the sums for each set of combinations generated in sub-task 1 and 2 for sub-task 3 and 4.
    3. Use the LLM Debate block to find the common combinations that satisfy both conditions for sub-task 5.

Additionally, the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99, which restricts the possible digits that can be used.

The top row forms a two-digit number, and the bottom row forms a three-digit number. We are given that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. Therefore, if the number in the top row is x and the number in the bottom row is y, then x + y = 999. Additionally, the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom (the columns) must be 99. Thus, the digits in the bottom row must be chosen such that they contribute to both conditions. Since the top row is a two-digit number, it can range from 0 to 99, meaning the bottom row, being a three-digit number, can range from 900 to 999.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    **Further Decomposition:**
    Last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1: Generate all possible three-digit numbers for the top row.
    Last sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2: Generate all possible three-digit numbers for the bottom row.
    Last sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 3: Based on sub-task 1 and 2, filter combinations where the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999.
    Last sub-task 4 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4: Based on sub-task 1 and 2, filter combinations where the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.
    Last sub-task 5 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 5: Based on sub-task 3 and 4, identify common combinations that satisfy both conditions.

    **Improved subtask architecture:**
    Last sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 1 and 2, CoT-SC for sub-task 3 and 4, LLM Debate for sub-task 5) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 1 and 2, Reflexion for sub-task 3 and 4, CoT-SC for sub-task 5). The main difference is using Reflexion to iteratively refine the possible combinations for sub-task 3 and 4, and using CoT-SC for sub-task 5 to ensure consistency and accuracy in identifying common combinations.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    It is known that 0, 605, 45, 20, 1000 are not correct answers.

The top row can be any three-digit number from 000 to 999, inclusive.

The condition given is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. We need to ensure that the numbers generated meet these criteria.; answer - All possible three-digit numbers for the bottom row are those that can be formed by digits 0-9, such that the sum with the top row number equals 999 and the vertical sum equals 99. However, without additional constraints or methods to systematically generate these numbers, this task requires further decomposition or constraints.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - To solve this sub-task, we need to find all pairs of numbers (top row and bottom row) such that their sum is 999 when read left to right. From sub-task 1, we have all possible three-digit numbers for the top row (000 to 999). For each number x in the top row, the corresponding number in the bottom row is 999-x.

This involves iterating over all possible three-digit numbers for the top row, calculating the corresponding bottom row such that their sum is 999, and checking if the sum of the digits in each column equals 9.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    Last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1: Generate all possible three-digit numbers for the top row.
    Last sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2: Generate all possible three-digit numbers for the bottom row.
    Last sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 3: Based on sub-task 1 and 2, filter combinations where the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999.
    Last sub-task 4 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4: Based on sub-task 1 and 2, filter combinations where the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.
    Last sub-task 5 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 5: Based on sub-task 3 and 4, identify common combinations that satisfy both conditions.

    **Improved subtask architecture:**
    Last sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 1 and 2, CoT-SC for sub-task 3 and 4, LLM Debate for sub-task 5) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 1 and 2, Reflexion for sub-task 3 and 4, CoT-SC for sub-task 5). The main difference is using Reflexion to iteratively refine the possible combinations for sub-task 3 and 4, and using CoT-SC for sub-task 5 to ensure consistency and accuracy in identifying common combinations.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    It is known that 0, 605, 45, 20, 1000 are not correct answers.

sub_tasks: [&#39;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The problem involves finding all possible three-digit numbers that can be placed in the top row of a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. The top row forms a three-digit number, and the bottom row forms another three-digit number. Since the total sum is 999, the top row number must be less than or equal to 999. Additionally, the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom must be 99. A systematic way to generate all possible three-digit numbers for the top row is needed.; answer - The possible three-digit numbers for the top row are those that, when added to a corresponding three-digit number in the bottom row, sum to 999. These numbers range from 0 to 999. However, since the grid must satisfy the additional condition for the columns, further constraints apply. For now, I will list numbers from 0 to 999 for the top row. \n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider the constraints imposed by the columns and the sum of 99 to further narrow down the possibilities.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To solve the sub-task, we need to find all possible three-digit numbers that can be formed by the bottom row of the grid. The grid has two rows, and each row forms a number when read left to right. For the bottom row, this number is a three-digit number. The sum of the two numbers formed by reading each row left to right must be 999. Therefore, if the number formed by the top row is x, the number formed by the bottom row is 999 - x. The number formed by reading the bottom row is a three-digit number, so it must be between 100 and 999 inclusive. We need to find all such numbers that satisfy these conditions.; answer - From the example given, the bottom row is 991. This implies that the top row is 8 since 8 + 991 = 999. To generate all possible three-digit numbers for the bottom row, we need to consider the range from 100 to 999. For each possible number y in this range, the top row number would be 999 - y, and it should be a valid two-digit number (since the top row is a two-digit number). Therefore, the bottom row numbers are all three-digit numbers y such that 999 - y is a two-digit number. This means 999 - y must be between 10 and 99. Solving 999 - y = 10 gives y = 989, and solving 999 - y = 99 gives y = 900. Thus, y ranges from 900 to 989. Therefore, the possible three-digit numbers for the bottom row are 900, 901, ..., 989.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The task involves finding combinations of numbers for the top and bottom rows such that their sum is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. From sub-task 1, the top row numbers range from 0 to 999, but realistically they must be two-digit numbers since the example shows a two-digit top row number. From sub-task 2, the bottom row numbers range from 900 to 989. The problem is complex because it involves multiple constraints that need to be satisfied simultaneously, making it difficult to find all valid combinations without a systematic approach. The constraints on the column sums further complicate the problem.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider using a systematic approach to iterate through possible two-digit numbers for the top row and corresponding valid three-digit numbers for the bottom row, ensuring that both the row sums and column sums meet the given conditions.\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The problem involves placing digits in a 2x3 grid with constraints on the sums of numbers formed horizontally and vertically. The horizontal sums must equal 999, and the vertical sums must equal 99. The previous attempts concluded there were no valid combinations, possibly due to errors in assumptions or constraints. However, the example provided does show a valid configuration, indicating that valid combinations do exist. The key is to find combinations where the top and bottom rows add to 999, and each column adds to 99. The example grid shows that such configurations are possible.; answer - There are valid combinations where the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99, such as the example provided: Top row: 008, Bottom row: 991, where 0+9=9, 0+9=9, 8+1=9, satisfying the vertical sum constraint of 99.\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The problem requires finding combinations of numbers placed in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Sub-task 3 involves filtering combinations where the horizontal sum is 999, and sub-task 4 involves filtering combinations where the vertical sum is 99. The common combinations satisfying both conditions are needed. From the example provided and the constraints, combinations like the one in the example (0, 0, 8 on the top row and 9, 9, 1 on the bottom row) satisfy both conditions. The task is complex due to the interaction of constraints, but it is solvable with systematic checking.; answer - 1&#39;]

From the example provided and the constraints, combinations like the one in the example (0, 0, 8 on the top row and 9, 9, 1 on the bottom row) satisfy both conditions. The task is complex due to the interaction of constraints, but it is solvable with systematic checking.\n\nAnswer:1&#39;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;The current sub-tasks are not fully solvable, as indicated by the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; marker in sub-tasks 1, 3, and 4. This suggests that further decomposition is necessary, especially for tasks that require systematic checking of combinations. The sub-task 5, although providing a response, is based on incorrect assumptions due to previous sub-tasks not being fully solvable.&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks do not include all necessary information from the original query. Specifically, sub-tasks 3 and 4 failed to provide valid combinations that satisfy both the horizontal and vertical sum conditions. The information flow between sub-tasks is incomplete or incorrect, and some critical information is missing or not adequately processed.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score remains at 0.0%, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The final response does not adequately address the original question, and the repeated incorrect answer suggests a need for better sub-task decomposition and block connections.&#39;}

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    Last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1: Generate all possible three-digit numbers for the top row that are less than 999 and consider constraints from vertical sums.
    Last sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2: Generate all possible three-digit numbers for the bottom row that are greater than 100 and consider constraints from vertical sums.
    Last sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 3: Based on sub-task 1 and 2, filter combinations where the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999 and check column constraints.
    Last sub-task 4 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4: Based on sub-task 1 and 2, filter combinations where the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99, ensuring column constraints are satisfied.
    Last sub-task 5 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 5: Based on sub-task 3 and 4, identify common combinations that satisfy both conditions.

    **Improved subtask architecture:**
    Last sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 1 and 2, Reflexion for sub-task 3 and 4, CoT-SC for sub-task 5) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 1 and 2, Reflexion for sub-task 3 and 4, LLM Debate for sub-task 5). The main difference is using LLM Debate to allow multiple perspectives to refine the possible combinations for sub-task 5, ensuring accuracy in identifying common combinations.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    It is known that 0, 605, 45, 20, 1000, 1 are not correct answers.

From sub-task 1, the top row must be a three-digit number less than 999, with each column&#39;s digits summing to 9.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

However, sub-task 1 still contains a &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; marker, indicating that it requires further decomposition.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    Last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 1: Generate all possible combinations of digits for each column, considering both the vertical sum constraint and the horizontal sum constraint.
    Last sub-task 2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2: Based on sub-task 1, generate possible combinations for the top row that satisfy the column constraints.
    Last sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 3: Based on sub-task 1, generate possible combinations for the bottom row that satisfy the column constraints.

    **Improved subtask architecture:**

The main difference is using Reflexion to iteratively refine possible combinations for sub-tasks 2 and 3, and using LLM Debate to ensure accuracy in identifying common combinations for sub-task 4.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    It is known that 0, 605, 45, 20, 1000, 1, (108, 891), (207, 792), (306, 693), (405, 594), (504, 495), (603, 396), (702, 297), (801, 198) are not correct answers.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks are not fully solvable. Sub-task 4 contains &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating difficulty in finding valid combinations.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    Last sub-task 4 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4: Determine valid top and bottom row combinations for each column independently, ensuring that both the horizontal and vertical sum constraints are satisfied.
    Last sub-task 5 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 5: Based on sub-task 4, combine valid column-wise combinations to form complete grid solutions, ensuring all constraints are met.

The main difference is using LLM Debate to finalize and verify complete grid solutions, rather than just column combinations.

The horizontal constraint is that the numbers formed by the rows sum to 999, and the vertical constraint is that the numbers formed by the columns sum to 99. This requires considering each column separately and ensuring the digits chosen satisfy both constraints simultaneously.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Break down the problem by considering each column separately and generating combinations that satisfy the vertical sum constraint, then check which of these combinations also satisfy the horizontal sum constraint.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The problem involves generating digit combinations for the top row of a 2x3 grid that satisfy both the horizontal sum constraint (the rows sum to 999) and the vertical sum constraint (the columns sum to 99). This requires a systematic approach to test combinations for each column. However, without specific constraints or a systematic breakdown of steps, it is challenging to ensure all conditions are met. The task is complex due to the interdependent constraints on both rows and columns, making it difficult to generate valid combinations without a more detailed approach.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Break down the problem by determining the possible digit combinations for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint, then filter these combinations to find those that also satisfy the horizontal sum constraint.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The task involves finding combinations for the bottom row that satisfy both the vertical and horizontal constraints. The vertical constraint is that the sum of the columns equals 99, and the horizontal constraint is that the sum of the numbers formed by the rows equals 999. Without specific combinations or a systematic approach from sub-task 1, it&#39;s challenging to determine valid combinations for the bottom row. This makes the task complex, suggesting that further decomposition or explicit guidance is needed.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Explicitly list possible combinations for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint, then identify which combinations satisfy the horizontal sum constraint for the bottom row.\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The task requires finding combinations for the top and bottom rows of a 2x3 grid that satisfy both the horizontal and vertical sum constraints. The horizontal constraint is that the sum of the numbers formed by the rows equals 999, and the vertical constraint is that the sum of the columns equals 99. This involves a complex interdependency between the digits in the grid, and without a systematic breakdown or explicit constraints, it is challenging to determine valid combinations. A detailed approach is needed to explore possible combinations for each column, ensuring that both constraints are satisfied simultaneously.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Begin by listing all possible digit combinations for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint of 99, then examine these combinations to find those that also satisfy the horizontal sum constraint of 999 for the entire grid. This systematic exploration can help in identifying valid top and bottom row combinations.\nSub-task 5 output: thinking - The problem requires finding a valid 2x3 grid of digits that satisfies two constraints: the sum of the two numbers formed by the rows equals 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by the columns equals 99. This is a complex combinatorial problem due to the interdependencies between the digits in the grid. Many possible combinations have already been ruled out as incorrect, indicating the difficulty in finding the correct solution. Without a systematic method or computational assistance, it is challenging to manually identify the correct grid configuration.; answer - &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: A systematic computational approach is needed to explore all possible grid configurations that satisfy both constraints. Consider generating all possible combinations for the columns that sum to 99 and checking these against the row sum constraint of 999. This could help in efficiently identifying valid solutions.&#34;]

This requires a systematic approach to test combinations for each column. However, without specific constraints or a systematic breakdown of steps, it is challenging to ensure all conditions are met. The task is complex due to the interdependent constraints on both rows and columns, making it difficult to generate valid combinations without a more detailed approach.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Break down the problem by determining the possible digit combinations for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint, then filter these combinations to find those that also satisfy the horizontal sum constraint.\nCoT agent BfMB, on the purpose of generating bottom row combinations, thinking: To generate possible combinations for the bottom row of the grid, we need to consider the constraints imposed by the vertical sums of each column. Each column must sum to a digit that contributes to the total vertical sum of 99. Additionally, the horizontal constraint requires that the sum of the numbers formed by the rows equals 999. However, without specific combinations from sub-task 1, it&#39;s challenging to determine which combinations satisfy both constraints.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Break down the problem by explicitly listing possible combinations for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint, then identify which combinations satisfy the horizontal sum constraint for the bottom row.\nCritic agent lPNn, on the purpose of generating bottom row combinations, feedback: The response from Chain-of-Thought Agent BfMB indicates that the problem is complex due to the dual constraints of horizontal and vertical sums. The agent suggests breaking down the problem by focusing on the vertical sum constraints first, then checking which combinations also satisfy the horizontal sum constraint.; correct: The response correctly identifies the difficulty in generating combinations that satisfy both constraints and provides a reasonable suggestion for approaching the problem.\nCoT agent BfMB, on the purpose of generating bottom row combinations, thinking: The task involves finding combinations of digits for the bottom row that satisfy both the vertical sum constraint (each column summing to a part of 99) and the horizontal sum constraint (the sum of numbers formed by the rows equaling 999).

The vertical sum constraint requires that the sum of the digits in each column equals a part of 99, while the horizontal sum constraint requires that the numbers formed by reading the rows sum to 999. Without specific combinations from the previous sub-task, it&#39;s challenging to determine which combinations satisfy both constraints. This makes the problem complex and suggests that further decomposition or information is needed.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Explicitly list possible combinations for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint, then identify which combinations satisfy the horizontal sum constraint for the bottom row.\nCritic agent lPNn, on the purpose of generating bottom row combinations, feedback: The problem involves finding digit combinations for the bottom row of a 2x3 grid that satisfy both horizontal and vertical constraints. The horizontal constraint is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. The vertical constraint is that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. The problem is complex because it requires considering all possible combinations of digits that satisfy both constraints simultaneously.; correct: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Explicitly list possible combinations for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint, then identify which combinations satisfy the horizontal sum constraint for the bottom row.\nCoT agent BfMB, on the purpose of generating bottom row combinations, thinking: The task involves finding combinations for the bottom row that satisfy both the vertical and horizontal constraints. The vertical constraint is that the sum of the columns equals 99, and the horizontal constraint is that the sum of the numbers formed by the rows equals 999. Without specific combinations or a systematic approach from sub-task 1, it&#39;s challenging to determine valid combinations for the bottom row. This makes the task complex, suggesting that further decomposition or explicit guidance is needed.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Explicitly list possible combinations for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint, then identify which combinations satisfy the horizontal sum constraint for the bottom row.\nCoT agent wTOr, on the purpose of determining valid column combinations, thinking: The task requires finding combinations for the top and bottom rows of a 2x3 grid that satisfy both the horizontal and vertical sum constraints. The horizontal constraint is that the sum of the numbers formed by the rows equals 999, and the vertical constraint is that the sum of the columns equals 99. This involves a complex interdependency between the digits in the grid, and without a systematic breakdown or explicit constraints, it is challenging to determine valid combinations. A detailed approach is needed to explore possible combinations for each column, ensuring that both constraints are satisfied simultaneously.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Begin by listing all possible digit combinations for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint of 99, then examine these combinations to find those that also satisfy the horizontal sum constraint of 999 for the entire grid. This systematic exploration can help in identifying valid top and bottom row combinations.\nDebate agent 0Zkk, on the purpose of identifying complete grid solutions, thinking: The task involves combining valid column-wise combinations to form complete grid solutions, ensuring both the horizontal sum of 999 and the vertical sum of 99 are met. Given the complexity of finding valid combinations without explicit constraints or a systematic breakdown, it is challenging to determine the correct solutions without further information or a detailed exploration of possibilities.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: A systematic approach is needed to explore all possible combinations for the grid, ensuring both constraints are satisfied. Listing all possible digit combinations for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint of 99, and then examining these combinations to find those that also satisfy the horizontal sum constraint of 999, could help in identifying valid solutions.\nDebate agent OqBH, on the purpose of identifying complete grid solutions, thinking: The task is to find valid combinations for the digits in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the numbers formed by the rows equals 999, and the sum of the numbers formed by the columns equals 99. This involves exploring different combinations of digits for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint, and then checking if these combinations also satisfy the horizontal sum constraint. The problem is complex due to the interdependencies between the digits and the need to satisfy both constraints simultaneously. The provided list of incorrect answers suggests that many combinations have already been considered and ruled out, indicating the difficulty of the problem.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: A systematic approach is needed to explore all possible combinations of digits for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint of 99. Once these combinations are identified, they should be checked against the horizontal sum constraint of 999 to find valid solutions. Consider using a computational method to explore the large number of possibilities efficiently.\nDebate agent MYYf, on the purpose of identifying complete grid solutions, thinking: The task involves finding combinations of digits for a 2x3 grid that satisfy two constraints: the sum of the numbers formed by the rows equals 999, and the sum of the numbers formed by the columns equals 99. This requires considering all possible digit combinations for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint, and then checking if they also satisfy the horizontal sum constraint. The problem is complex due to the interdependencies between the digits in the grid and the need to satisfy both constraints simultaneously. The given information about invalid solutions helps to narrow down the search space, but the task remains challenging.; answer: &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: A systematic approach is needed to explore possible combinations for each column that satisfy the vertical sum constraint of 99, and then check if these combinations also satisfy the horizontal sum constraint of 999.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

Each column can have digits from 0 to 9, and the sum of the two numbers formed horizontally should be 999. This requires careful consideration of possible digit arrangements that satisfy both the horizontal and vertical constraints.; answer - Possible combinations for each column are: Column 1: (0, 9), (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1), (9, 0); Column 2: (0, 9), (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1), (9, 0); Column 3: (0, 81), (1, 80), (2, 79), (3, 78), (4, 77), (5, 76), (6, 75), (7, 74), (8, 73), (9, 72).\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The horizontal sum constraint requires that the sum of the numbers formed by the top row and bottom row equals 999. From the feedback, the bottom row is fixed as 991, so the top row must be 008 to satisfy the equation 008 + 991 = 999. Therefore, the top row digits must be 0, 0, and 8 for columns 1, 2, and 3, respectively.; answer - Column 1: 0; Column 2: 0; Column 3: 8.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The task is to find valid combinations for the bottom row of a 2x3 grid, ensuring the horizontal sum is 999 and the vertical sum is 99. Given the top row digits from sub-task 1 as (0, 0, 8), the bottom row digits must satisfy the horizontal equation 0 + 991 = 999, meaning the bottom row digits must be (9, 9, 1). This satisfies the vertical sum constraints as well: the first column sums to 9, the second column sums to 9, and the third column sums to 81, which are consistent with the top row (0, 0, 8) and bottom row (9, 9, 1). Thus, the valid bottom row combination is (9, 9, 1).; answer - (9, 9, 1)\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The task is to find all valid grid configurations that satisfy the given constraints. The constraints are that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the rows left to right must be 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the columns top to bottom must be 99. From the previous analysis and the information given, the only valid grid configuration that satisfies both constraints is the one with the top row as (0, 0, 8) and the bottom row as (9, 9, 1). This configuration satisfies both the horizontal and vertical sum constraints, and no other combinations work given the constraints and the known incorrect answers. Therefore, there is only one valid configuration.; answer - 1&#39;]

The horizontal sum constraint implies that the sum of the numbers formed by the top row digits must equal 999 when combined with the bottom row digits. Given the sub-task 1 combinations, we need to ensure that the sum of the digits in each column matches the constraints while also forming valid numbers horizontally. The bottom row sum is fixed, so we need to adjust the top row accordingly.; answer: The valid top row combinations for each column are: Column 1: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; Column 2: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; Column 3: 8. The top row of the third column is fixed at 8 to satisfy the horizontal sum constraint with the bottom row.\nCritic agent s8oX, on the purpose of generating top row combinations, feedback: The sub-task is asking for valid top row combinations for each column independently, ensuring the horizontal sum constraints are met. The horizontal sum constraint is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. Therefore, the top row digits must be chosen such that they complement the bottom row digits to form numbers that sum to 999. Since the bottom row is 991, the top row must be 008 to satisfy the horizontal sum constraint (008 + 991 = 999). Thus, the valid top row combinations are: Column 1: 0; Column 2: 0; Column 3: 8.; correct: The valid top row combinations for each column are: Column 1: 0; Column 2: 0; Column 3: 8.\nCoT agent 04fo, on the purpose of generating top row combinations, thinking: The horizontal sum constraint requires that the sum of the numbers formed by the top row and bottom row equals 999.

The top row digits have already been determined in sub-task 1, and they are: Column 1: 0, Column 2: 0, Column 3: 8. Therefore, the bottom row digits for each column must satisfy these equations: Bottom1 + 0 = 9, Bottom2 + 0 = 9, Bottom3 + 8 = 91. This means Bottom1 = 9, Bottom2 = 9, and Bottom3 = 83. However, since a single digit cannot be 83, we must re-evaluate the constraints and check for possible errors or assumptions.; answer: 0\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the constraints or assumptions, as the third column&#39;s bottom digit cannot be 83, indicating a need for a different approach or correction in the assumptions.\nCritic agent tBrn, on the purpose of generating bottom row combinations, feedback: The sub-task requires finding valid combinations for the bottom row digits of a 2x3 grid, ensuring the sum of the numbers formed horizontally equals 999, and vertically equals 99.

The top row digits are fixed as (0, 0, 8) based on sub-task 1. For the horizontal sum to be 999, the bottom row digits must be (9, 9, 1) because 0+991=999. For the vertical sum to be 99, the columns sum to (9, 9, 81), which aligns with the top and bottom row digits (0, 0, 8) and (9, 9, 1).; answer: (9, 9, 1)\nCritic agent tBrn, on the purpose of generating bottom row combinations, feedback: The task is to find valid combinations for the bottom row of a 2x3 grid, given the horizontal sum constraint of 999 and the vertical sum constraint of 99. The top row digits are fixed as (0, 0, 8).; correct: The valid bottom row combination is (9, 9, 1) because it satisfies both the horizontal sum 0+991=999 and the vertical sum 9+9+81=99.\nCoT agent 8BqV, on the purpose of generating bottom row combinations, thinking: The task involves generating valid bottom row combinations for a 2x3 grid, ensuring the horizontal sum is 999 and the vertical sum is 99.

Given the top row digits from sub-task 1 as (0, 0, 8), the bottom row digits must satisfy the horizontal equation 0 + 991 = 999, meaning the bottom row digits must be (9, 9, 1). This satisfies the vertical sum constraints as well: the first column sums to 9, the second column sums to 9, and the third column sums to 81, which are consistent with the top row (0, 0, 8) and bottom row (9, 9, 1). Thus, the valid bottom row combination is (9, 9, 1).; answer: (9, 9, 1)\nDebate agent lTms, on the purpose of identifying complete grid solutions, thinking: We need to find a valid grid configuration where the sum of the top row number and the bottom row number is 999, and the sum of the vertical columns is 99. From previous sub-tasks, we know that the only valid top row is (0, 0, 8) and the only valid bottom row is (9, 9, 1). Combining these, we get the grid: top row (0, 0, 8), bottom row (9, 9, 1). This satisfies both the horizontal sum (008 + 991 = 999) and the vertical sums (0+9=9, 0+9=9, 8+1=9, which sum to 99).; answer: 1\nDebate agent GRxy, on the purpose of identifying complete grid solutions, thinking: We need to find all valid grid configurations where the sum of the numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. The given constraints and examples suggest that the only valid configuration is the one where the top row is 008 and the bottom row is 991. This ensures that horizontally 008 + 991 = 999, and vertically 0 + 9 = 9, 0 + 9 = 9, 8 + 1 = 9, which sum to 99.

The grid must satisfy both the horizontal sum of 999 and the vertical sum of 99. The example given in the problem already satisfies these constraints, and it&#39;s the only combination that works given the constraints. The known incorrect solutions suggest that no other combinations satisfy both the horizontal and vertical constraints simultaneously.; answer: 1\nFinal Decision agent, on the purpose of consolidating debate results, thinking: The task is to find all valid grid configurations that satisfy the given constraints. The constraints are that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the rows left to right must be 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the columns top to bottom must be 99. From the previous analysis and the information given, the only valid grid configuration that satisfies both constraints is the one with the top row as (0, 0, 8) and the bottom row as (9, 9, 1). This configuration satisfies both the horizontal and vertical sum constraints, and no other combinations work given the constraints and the known incorrect answers. Therefore, there is only one valid configuration.; answer: 1&#34;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

The main difference is the explicit validation against known incorrect solutions, ensuring only valid configurations are considered.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    It is known that 0, 605, 45, 20, 1000, 1, (108, 891), (207, 792), (306, 693), (405, 594), (504, 495), (603, 396), (702, 297), (801, 198), (900, 099), (990, 009) are not correct answers.
