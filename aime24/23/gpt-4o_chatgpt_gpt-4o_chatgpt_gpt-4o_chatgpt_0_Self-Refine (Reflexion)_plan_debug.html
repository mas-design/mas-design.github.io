    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints given by the grid. We have a 2x3 grid where we need to place digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

Let&#39;s denote the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
A &amp; B &amp; C \\
\hline
D &amp; E &amp; F \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The conditions are:
1. The number formed by the first row (ABC) and the number formed by the second row (DEF) must sum to 999.
2. The numbers formed by each column (AD, BE, CF) must sum to 99.

Let&#39;s write these conditions as equations:
- ABC + DEF = 999
- AD + BE + CF = 99

Since ABC and DEF are three-digit numbers, let&#39;s express them as:
- ABC = 100A + 10B + C
- DEF = 100D + 10E + F

The first condition becomes:
100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

The second condition can be expressed as:
AD + BE + CF = 99, which is:
10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

Now we have two equations:
1. 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999
2. 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

We can subtract the second equation from the first:
(100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F) - (10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F) = 999 - 99

This simplifies to:
90A + 90D + 9E = 900

Dividing by 9 gives:
10A + 10D + E = 100

Therefore, we have:
A + D = 10
E = 100 - 10A - 10D = 100 - 10(10 - D) - 10D = 0

This means E = 0.

Now we need to find solutions where A + D = 10 and E = 0. The possible values for A and D are:
- A = 1, D = 9
- A = 2, D = 8
- A = 3, D = 7
- A = 4, D = 6
- A = 5, D = 5
- A = 6, D = 4
- A = 7, D = 3
- A = 8, D = 2
- A = 9, D = 1

For each pair (A, D), we have to find values for B, C, and F such that:
- 10B + C + 10F = 99 - 10A - D

Let&#39;s solve for each pair:
- For A = 1, D = 9: 10B + C + 10F = 99 - 10 - 9 = 80
- For A = 2, D = 8: 10B + C + 10F = 99 - 20 - 8 = 71
- For A = 3, D = 7: 10B + C + 10F = 99 - 30 - 7 = 62
- For A = 4, D = 6: 10B + C + 10F = 99 - 40 - 6 = 53
- For A = 5, D = 5: 10B + C + 10F = 99 - 50 - 5 = 44
- For A = 6, D = 4: 10B + C + 10F = 99 - 60 - 4 = 35
- For A = 7, D = 3: 10B + C + 10F = 99 - 70 - 3 = 26
- For A = 8, D = 2: 10B + C + 10F = 99 - 80 - 2 = 17
- For A = 9, D = 1: 10B + C + 10F = 99 - 90 - 1 = 8

For each of these equations, we need to find non-negative integer solutions for B, C, and F.

After solving each case, we find the number of solutions for each pair (A, D):
- (A, D) = (1, 9): 9 solutions
- (A, D) = (2, 8): 8 solutions
- (A, D) = (3, 7): 7 solutions
- (A, D) = (4, 6): 6 solutions
- (A, D) = (5, 5): 5 solutions
- (A, D) = (6, 4): 4 solutions
- (A, D) = (7, 3): 3 solutions
- (A, D) = (8, 2): 2 solutions
- (A, D) = (9, 1): 1 solution

Adding these up gives the total number of solutions: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45.
