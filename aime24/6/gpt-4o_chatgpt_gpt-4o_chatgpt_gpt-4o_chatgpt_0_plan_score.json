    "thinking": "Answer ID 1 and Answer ID 2 both correctly outline the approach to solve the problem by determining the dimensions that maximize the diagonal of the box, which is crucial for finding the radius of the smallest containing sphere. They both state that r^2 should be expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) and find \\(p+q\\). However, they do not provide the detailed calculations that lead to the final answer of 77, making it unclear how they arrived at that conclusion. Answer ID 0 correctly identifies the need to minimize the diagonal but incorrectly states the final answer as 169 without showing the steps to reach this conclusion. Answer ID 3 provides a detailed and correct calculation, showing how the minimum value of \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\) is 27, leading to \\(r^2 = \\frac{27}{4}\\) and \\(p+q = 31\\). This is the correct and well-justified answer. Answer ID 4 fails to provide a solution, stating the complexity of solving the system of equations and does not reach a conclusion. Answer ID 5 incorrectly assumes dimensions (1, 1, 23) which do not satisfy the surface area condition, leading to an incorrect final answer of 535. Answer ID 6 concludes that there are no integer solutions, which is incorrect as the problem does not require integer dimensions, only that the conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Answer ID 3 is the best answer.",
