    <pre>Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

### thinking by Debate Agent CuuG:
To find the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box with given constraints, we need to determine the box&#39;s diagonal, which is the largest distance across the box. The diagonal is given by \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \). The radius of the sphere must be at least half of this diagonal. Given the surface area \( 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 \) and volume \( xyz = 23 \), we use the identity \( (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) \) to express \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) as \( (x + y + z)^2 - 54 \). Solving for \( x, y, z \) that satisfy these constraints, we find that the minimum value of \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) is 27. Thus, the diagonal is \( \sqrt{27} \), and the radius of the sphere is \( \frac{\sqrt{27}}{2} \). Therefore, \( r^2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{27}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{27}{4} \), and \( p + q = 27 + 4 = 31 \).

    <pre>To find the smallest sphere that can contain each box in the set \( \mathcal{B} \), we need to determine the diagonal of the box, which is the longest distance across the box. The diagonal is given by \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \). The radius of the sphere must be at least half of this diagonal. Given the surface area \( 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 \) and volume \( xyz = 23 \), we use the identity \( (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) \) to express \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) as \( (x + y + z)^2 - 54 \).
