In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.

        "response": "The problem is to find the number of residents who own all four items. \\n We know the total number of residents, those owning exactly two items, and those owning exactly three items. \\n The inclusion-exclusion principle helps find the sum of pairwise intersections, but without specific values for each pairwise intersection, the problem remains under-constrained. \\n Previous attempts and feedback indicate missing information or insufficient constraints to solve the problem uniquely. \\n The sum of pairwise intersections was calculated as 1139, but this does not help without knowing each pair individually. \\n Thus, additional data or assumptions are needed to find a unique solution. \\n Answer:1139",
