    <pre>Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

### thinking by Debate Agent lsLG:
To find the number of residents who own all four items, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We know that there are 900 residents in total, and each owns a bag of candy hearts. For the other three items, we have 195 residents who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. Additionally, 437 residents own exactly two of these items, and 234 own exactly three items. To find the number of residents who own all four items, we need to find the number who own all three of the other items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) since owning all four means they also own the candy hearts. Using the formula for the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we calculate |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + |D ∩ G ∩ S|. We know |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 437 + 2*234 = 905 because each resident who owns exactly three items is counted twice in the pairwise intersections. Therefore, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 905 + 234 = 453. Since all residents own a bag of candy hearts, the total number of residents is 900. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 900 - 453 = 447.

### thinking by Debate Agent dstk:
To find the number of residents who own all four items, we apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We know the number of residents who own each item and those who own exactly two or exactly three items. The inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets is: |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + |D ∩ G ∩ S|. Given |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 437 + 2*234 = 905, we calculate |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 905 + 234 = 453. Since all residents own candy hearts, we have |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = 900, leading to 900 = 453 + N. Solving for N gives us N = 900 - 453 = 447.

    <pre>Both agents applied the principle of inclusion-exclusion correctly to determine the number of residents who own all four items. They calculated the union of the three sets (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) and subtracted it from the total number of residents to find those who own all four items, including the candy hearts, which everyone owns.
