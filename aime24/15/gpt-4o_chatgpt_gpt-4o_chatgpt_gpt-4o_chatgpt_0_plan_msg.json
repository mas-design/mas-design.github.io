Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)\n\nYour objective is to \n\n(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like 'output exactly the following...' is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.\n\nMake sure \n\n(a) Include sub-task ID  and 'Based on (task i)' in the instruction of a sub-task. \nFor example, \nSimilarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2's instruction should be\n'Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1's instruction)'\n\nSimilarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3's instruction should be\n'Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3's instruction)'\nThis helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task \nFor example,\n`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`\nYou can see it clearly states 'based on what sub-tasks'\n\n(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. \n\n(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. \nYou should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.\n\nFor example, if the exising architectures are 'COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate' and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:\n\nExample Setup\n\nResulting sub-tasks:\nsub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4\n\nAvailable architectures:\nCOT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate\n\nNetwork with 3 Layers:\n\nLayer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  \nLayer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   \nLayer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  \n\nConnection Strategies:\n\n1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.\nExample: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -> [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)\n\n2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.\nExample: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -> [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -> [COT -> Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -> Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\n1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.\n\n2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. \n\nYour aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the 'code' entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\n\n\n# The utility code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom typing import Union\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\n\nimport openai\nimport backoff\nfrom utils import random_id\n\n# Initialize the OpenAI client\nclient = openai.OpenAI()\n\n# Named tuple for holding task information\nInfo = namedtuple('Info', ['name', 'author', 'content', 'prompt', 'sub_tasks', 'agents', 'iteration_idx'])\n\n# Format instructions for LLM response\nFORMAT_INST = lambda request_keys: f\"Reply EXACTLY with the following JSON format.\n{str(request_keys)}\nDO NOT MISS ANY FIELDS AND MAKE SURE THE JSON FORMAT IS CORRECT!\n\"\n\n# Description of the role for the LLM\nROLE_DESC = lambda role: f\"You are a {role}.\"\n\n@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, openai.RateLimitError)\ndef get_json_response_from_gpt(msg, model, system_message, temperature=0.5):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to get JSON response from GPT model.\n    \n    Args:\n    - msg (str): The user message.\n    - model (str): The model to use.\n    - system_message (str): The system message.\n    - temperature (float): Sampling temperature.\n    \n    Returns:\n    - dict: The JSON response.\n    \"\"\"\n    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_message},\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": msg},\n        ],\n        temperature=temperature,\n        max_tokens=1024,\n        stop=None,\n        response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}\n    )\n    content = response.choices[0].message.content\n    json_dict = json.loads(content)\n    return json_dict\n\nclass LLMAgentBase():\n    \"\"\"\n    Attributes:\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, output_fields: list, agent_name: str,\n                 role='helpful assistant', model=None, temperature=None) -> None:\n        self.output_fields = output_fields\n        self.agent_name = agent_name\n\n        self.role = role\n        self.model = model\n        self.temperature = temperature\n        #

Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of \u201cInfos\u201d. You can get the content by Infos.content. \nDO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.\n\n\n## WRONG Implementation examples:\nHere are some mistakes you may make:\n\n1. This is WRONG: ```\nfeedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)\nfeedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)\n```\nIt is wrong to use \"Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)\". The returned \"feedback\" from LLMAgentBase is already Info.\n\n2. This is WRONG: ```\n# Debugging: Log the generated answer\nprint('Generated Answer:', ...)\nfeedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)\nif len(feedback_info) < 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements\n    return 'Error: Feedback info incomplete'\n```\nFirst, the len(feedback_info) will not work.\nSecond, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.\nThird, you should never print anything in the code.\nLastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.\n\n3. This is WRONG: ```\nall_thinking = []\nall_answers = []\nfor agent, role in zip(agents, roles):\n    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))\n    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)\n    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)\n\n# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers\naggregated_thinking = '\n'.join(all_thinking)\naggregated_answers = '\n'.join(all_answers)\n```\nYou SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.\n\n4. This is WRONG: ```\nreasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')\nresponse_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\n    \n# Extract the final answer from the response_infos\nfor info in response_infos:\n    if info.name == 'final_answer':\n        return info\n# Fallback if no answer is found\nreturn Info('answer', 'Final Decision Agent', 'No answer generated.', 0)\n```\n\n5. This is WRONG: ```\nreasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')\nthinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\nreturn answer   \n```\nYou MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.\n\n6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```\nthinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\n```\nYou MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition\n\n7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```\nreasoning_instruction = '...'\n```\nYou MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks\n\n\nYou should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.\nCORRECT example: ```\nreasoning_instruction = 'Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....'\nreasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')\nthinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)\nfinal_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)\n\n# Return only the final answer\nreturn final_answer   \n```\n\n\n\n# Your task\nYou are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature.

The problem involves determining the number of residents who own all four items among different combinations of ownership. The sub-tasks are as follows:\n\nSub-task 1: Calculate the total number of residents who own at least one of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade), excluding the bag of candy hearts, which everyone owns. This requires understanding the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nSub-task 2: Determine the number of residents who own exactly two of the three items. This involves using the given information about residents who own exactly two and three items.\n\nSub-task 3: Calculate the number of residents who own exactly three of the three items. This involves using the given number of residents who own exactly three items and adjusting for overlaps.\n\nSub-task 4: Based on the results from sub-tasks 1, 2, and 3, calculate the number of residents who own all four items, including the bag of candy hearts.\n\nThis decomposition ensures that each sub-task is straightforward enough for the existing blocks to handle, and together they lead to the final solution of the original question.\n\n**Overall Architecture:**\nWe will use a combination of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Refine (Reflexion) blocks to address each sub-task. CoT will be used for initial calculations, while Reflexion will refine the results based on feedback.\n\nImplementation:\n1. Use CoT to address sub-task 1 by calculating the number of residents owning at least one of the three items.\n2. Use CoT to address sub-task 2 by determining the number of residents owning exactly two of the three items.\n3. Use CoT to address sub-task 3 by calculating the number of residents owning exactly three of the three items.\n4. Use Reflexion to address sub-task 4 by refining the calculation of residents owning all four items based on previous outputs.\n\nThe architecture will ensure that each sub-task is handled by a block that can effectively solve it, and the connections between blocks facilitate the flow of information necessary for the final calculation.\n",

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

However, without pairwise intersection counts or additional specific data, finding the exact number of residents owning all four items is challenging. The problem lacks sufficient data to directly compute the desired number using standard inclusion-exclusion calculations.\n\nAnswer:300\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Provide pairwise intersection counts or additional data to accurately calculate the number of residents owning all four items."

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

We have |A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562. Also, we know that 437 residents own exactly two of these items, and 234 own exactly three. The inclusion-exclusion principle states: |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|.

However, we don't have enough information to find the exact numbers for |A \u2229 B|, |A \u2229 C|, and |B \u2229 C|.

To find the number of residents owning exactly two of the three items, we need to subtract the number of residents owning all three items from those owning at least two.

Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, the task reduces to finding those who own the other three items. We know that 234 residents own exactly three of these items, and 437 residents own exactly two. However, we lack the specific breakdown of how many residents own each pair of items, which is crucial for refining the intersection calculation. Without this information, it is challenging to accurately calculate the number of residents owning all four items. The previous attempts have not provided clarity on this breakdown, resulting in incorrect answers. Thus, the problem remains unsolved without additional data or a revised approach.; answer - 300\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Provide the number of residents who own exactly two out of the three items separately for each pair or reconsider the approach to find the number of residents owning all four items."

The inclusion-exclusion principle states: |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|. We need to determine the values of |A \u2229 B|, |A \u2229 C|, and |B \u2229 C|, but we know that |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 234 and that the sum of residents owning exactly two items is 437. However, we don't have enough information to find the exact numbers for |A \u2229 B|, |A \u2229 C|, and |B \u2229 C|. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of residents owning at least one of the three items without additional information.; answer: 300\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Provide the number of residents who own exactly two out of the three items separately, or the number of residents who own at least one of the items.\nCoT Agent 2, on the purpose of calculating residents owning exactly two items, thinking: We know that 437 residents own exactly two of the three items and 234 residents own all three items. To find the number of residents owning exactly two of the three items, we need to subtract the number of residents owning all three items from those owning at least two. However, the previous sub-task result of 300 seems incorrect or a placeholder, as it doesn't make sense with the given data. We need to confirm the correct number of residents owning at least one of the three items to proceed accurately.; answer: 203\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Confirm the number of residents owning at least one of the three items and provide the number of residents owning exactly two out of the three items separately.\nCoT Agent 3, on the purpose of calculating residents owning exactly three items, thinking: We are asked to find the number of residents owning exactly three of the three items: diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. We know from the problem statement that 234 residents own exactly three of these items. Therefore, the answer to this sub-task is straightforward as it is directly given in the problem.; answer: 234\nCoT Agent 4.2.2.1.1.1, on the purpose of calculating pairwise ownership, thinking: We need to determine the number of residents owning each pair of items individually. We know that 437 residents own exactly two of the items, and 234 residents own all three items. Let x be the number of residents who own exactly two of the items. Then, for each pair (e.g., diamond ring & golf clubs), we have: |A \u2229 B| = (number of residents owning both) - |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|. Without further breakdown of the 437 residents into specific pairs, we cannot determine the exact numbers for each pair.; answer: 300\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Provide the number of residents who own exactly two out of the three items separately for each pair.\nCoT Agent 4.2.2.1.1.2, on the purpose of refining overall intersection calculation, thinking: The original problem involves determining the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Given that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, the problem simplifies to finding the number who own the other three items. We know 234 residents own exactly three of the items, and 437 own exactly two. However, the previous sub-task failed to correctly determine the number of residents owning each pair of items, providing an incorrect answer of 300. Without the exact breakdown of residents owning each pair of items, we cannot accurately refine the intersection calculation. The problem requires additional information or a different approach to determine the number of residents owning all four items.; answer: 300\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Provide the number of residents who own exactly two out of the three items separately for each pair or reconsider the approach to find the number of residents owning all four items.\nCritic Agent 4.2.2.1.1.2, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The current approach to solving the intersection calculation is incorrect due to insufficient breakdown of residents owning each pair of items. The problem is complex as it requires precise information on how many residents own exactly two or three items, and the previous attempts have not provided this clarity.; answer: The problem requires additional information to accurately determine how many residents own all four items. Specifically, the number of residents who own exactly two out of the three items needs to be known separately for each pair.\nCoT Agent 4.2.2.1.1.2, on the purpose of refining calculation, thinking: The problem requires determining the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, the task simplifies to finding those who own the other three items.

This makes it hard to determine the number of residents owning all four items accurately.; answer: 300\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Provide the number of residents who own exactly two out of the three items separately for each pair or reconsider the approach to find the number of residents owning all four items.\nCoT Agent 4.2.2.1.1.2, on the purpose of refining calculation, thinking: The task is to determine the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, we only need to consider the other three items. We know that 234 residents own exactly three of these items, and 437 residents own exactly two. However, without the specific breakdown of how these 437 residents are distributed among the pairs of items, it is impossible to accurately calculate the number of residents owning all four items.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

To refine the calculation, we need to ensure the intersection estimates fit within the constraints provided. Without specific values for individual pairwise intersections, it's challenging to refine the calculation accurately.\n\nAnswer:790\n<TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Recalculate each pairwise intersection using the constraints of 437 owning exactly two items and 234 owning all three, ensuring the total does not exceed 790.

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

Reflect on the following points:\"\n\n1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. \n\n- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain <TOO_HARD>. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the <TOO_HARD> (you can see the 'Suggestions:' next to the <TOO_HARD> )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure\n\n- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase \n\n(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. \n\nWhen proposing new sub-task, make sure \n(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.\n(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. \n(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. \n(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state 'Based on the output of sub-task i..' in the sub-task instruction\n\n(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"

There are then two possibilities\n    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)\n    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed\nPlease jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.\n\n2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.\n\n3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. \n\nAnd then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.\n\nYour response should add new entries to the previous answers:\n\n\"reflection\": \n(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)\n(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)\n\n\"thought\": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. \n\nFor case (a), Give the \n\n(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the 'thought' entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task 1 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)' Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: 'output exactly the following:..', which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.\n\n\nFor case (b), Give the \n\n(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: 'last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-> (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)' Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify\n\nFor case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the\n\n(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the 'memeory' entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the 'memeory', i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.\n\n\n\"name\": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like \"new\" or \"improved\" in the name.)\n\n\"code\": Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in \"code\": Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. \nif single quote (') is used in string, then double quote (\") should be used for the whole string.\n\nThis is WRONG\n`f'CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's'`. \nThis is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell's) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f''). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f\"CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell's\"`\n"
