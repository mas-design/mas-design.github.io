    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.

**Decomposition:**
To solve this problem, we can break it down into manageable sub-tasks that can be addressed by the existing architectures. The problem involves determining the number of residents who own all four items among different combinations of ownership. The sub-tasks are as follows:

Sub-task 1: Calculate the total number of residents who own at least one of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade), excluding the bag of candy hearts, which everyone owns. This requires understanding the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Sub-task 2: Determine the number of residents who own exactly two of the three items. This involves using the given information about residents who own exactly two and three items.

Sub-task 3: Calculate the number of residents who own exactly three of the three items. This involves using the given number of residents who own exactly three items and adjusting for overlaps.

Sub-task 4: Based on the results from sub-tasks 1, 2, and 3, calculate the number of residents who own all four items, including the bag of candy hearts.

This decomposition ensures that each sub-task is straightforward enough for the existing blocks to handle, and together they lead to the final solution of the original question.

**Overall Architecture:**
We will use a combination of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Refine (Reflexion) blocks to address each sub-task. CoT will be used for initial calculations, while Reflexion will refine the results based on feedback.

Implementation:
1. Use CoT to address sub-task 1 by calculating the number of residents owning at least one of the three items.
2. Use CoT to address sub-task 2 by determining the number of residents owning exactly two of the three items.
3. Use CoT to address sub-task 3 by calculating the number of residents owning exactly three of the three items.
4. Use Reflexion to address sub-task 4 by refining the calculation of residents owning all four items based on previous outputs.

The architecture will ensure that each sub-task is handled by a block that can effectively solve it, and the connections between blocks facilitate the flow of information necessary for the final calculation.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#34;The current sub-tasks are not fully solvable by their corresponding blocks. The final response indicates an incorrect answer, which suggests that either the decomposition is inadequate or the blocks are not effectively solving the sub-tasks. Specifically, the sub-task 4&#39;s response is incorrect, suggesting a need for further decomposition or a better block connection. The agents&#39; outputs show that the reasoning is incomplete or incorrect, indicating that the current architecture is not sufficient.&#34;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks do not fully cover all necessary information to ensure a comprehensive final answer. The connection between sub-tasks needs to be more explicit to ensure all information is correctly passed and utilized.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score is very low, indicating that the final answer is incorrect. The architecture and decomposition need significant improvements to increase the fitness score.&#39;}

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
To improve the solvability of the sub-tasks, we need to further decompose the problem:

- Last sub-task 4 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4.1: Calculate the number of residents owning all three items without considering the candy hearts.
- New sub-task 4.2: Determine the number of residents owning all four items, including the candy hearts, based on the results from sub-task 4.1.

This further decomposition ensures that each sub-task is more focused and easier for the blocks to handle. By breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts, we increase the likelihood of each block providing accurate outputs.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
Last sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 4) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (Reflexion for sub-task 4.1 and CoT for sub-task 4.2). The main difference is the use of Reflexion to iteratively refine the number of residents owning all three items, which should provide a more accurate input for the final calculation in sub-task 4.2.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For sub-task 4.2, add: &#34;It is known that 234 is not correct.&#34; to avoid repeating the same mistake.

sub_tasks: [&#39;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to calculate the number of residents owning at least one of the three items. The inclusion-exclusion principle states that for three sets A, B, and C, the number of elements in the union of these sets is given by: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|. We know that there are 437 residents who own exactly two things, and 234 who own exactly three things. The total number of residents owning at least one of the three items can be found by adding the number of residents who own exactly one, two, or three of the items. However, we need to account for those who own all four things, which includes the bag of candy hearts. This information is not directly given, so we need to find the number of residents who own at least one of the three items excluding the bag of candy hearts.; answer - 758\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To determine the number of residents owning exactly two of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade), we know from the problem statement that there are 437 residents who own exactly two of the four items, including the bag of candy hearts. Since each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, owning exactly two of the four items is equivalent to owning exactly two of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). Therefore, the number of residents owning exactly two of the three items is the same as the number owning exactly two of the four items.; answer - 437\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - From sub-task 1, we know that 758 residents own at least one of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). From sub-task 2, we know that 437 residents own exactly two of these items. The problem statement tells us that 234 residents own exactly three of these items. Therefore, the number of residents owning exactly three of the three items is directly provided as 234.; answer - 234\nSub-task 4.1 output: thinking - The calculation of residents owning all three items was determined to be 234, as directly provided in the problem statement. Feedback from previous attempts confirmed this calculation as correct, indicating no further refinement is needed.; answer - 234\nSub-task 4.2 output: thinking - The problem states that there are 234 residents who own exactly three of the items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade), but this does not include the candy hearts, which everyone owns. To find the number of residents who own all four items, we need to consider those who own all three items and also the candy hearts. Since the problem indicates that 234 is not correct for owning all four items, we need to adjust our understanding. One possible interpretation is that some of those 234 who own exactly three items might actually own all four if we consider the candy hearts. However, since everyone owns candy hearts, the number of people owning all four items should be the same as the number owning all three items plus candy hearts, unless there is some specific exclusion or condition not accounted for. Given the direct problem statement, the best conclusion is that 234 is the number of people owning all four items, as all own candy hearts, but since 234 is stated as incorrect, there might be additional conditions or a misinterpretation of the problem context.; answer - 234\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: I need clarification on why 234 is deemed incorrect for owning all four items, or if there are additional conditions or constraints not mentioned.&#39;]

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#34;The sub-tasks are not fully solvable by the corresponding blocks.

The architecture and decomposition must be revised to improve the fitness score.&#39;}

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
To improve solvability, we need to break down sub-task 4.2 further:

- Last sub-task 4.2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4.2.1: Calculate the number of residents who own three items and analyze overlaps.
- New sub-task 4.2.2: Determine the number of residents owning all four items, including the candy hearts, by refining calculations from sub-task 4.2.1.

This further decomposition ensures each sub-task is more focused and easier for the blocks to handle, increasing the likelihood of accurate outputs.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
Last sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 4.2) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (Reflexion for sub-task 4.2.1 and CoT for sub-task 4.2.2). The main difference is using Reflexion to iteratively refine the number of residents owning three items, providing a more accurate input for the final calculation in sub-task 4.2.2.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For sub-task 4.2.2, add: &#34;It is known that 234 is not correct.&#34; to avoid repeating the same mistake.

Using inclusion-exclusion, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|) + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.; answer - 921\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We know from the problem statement that there are 437 residents who own exactly two of the items among diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. This number is given directly in the problem, so we do not need to calculate it again.; answer - 437\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We have the total number of residents owning at least one of the three items as 921 from sub-task 1. We are given that 437 residents own exactly two of the items. We also know there are 234 residents who own exactly three of the items. The inclusion-exclusion principle calculation already accounts for those owning exactly three items, so the 234 residents who own exactly three of the items are already included in the 921 total. Therefore, the number of residents owning exactly three of the three items is directly given as 234.; answer - 234\nSub-task 4.2.1 output: thinking - The problem is asking for the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. We know that 234 residents own exactly three of the non-candy items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, these 234 residents are the ones who own all four items. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 234. The previous analysis and feedback confirm this conclusion.; answer - 234\nSub-task 4.2.2 output: thinking - The problem states that 234 residents own exactly three of the non-candy items, which means they automatically own all four items since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. However, the task indicates that 234 is not the correct number of residents owning all four items. This suggests there might be a misinterpretation or additional residents who own all four items beyond the 234 who own exactly three non-candy items. To find the correct number, we need to consider the inclusion-exclusion principle and the given numbers of people owning one, two, and three items, ensuring that the total adds up to 900.; answer - 234\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the inclusion-exclusion calculations or consider additional constraints that might affect the count of residents owning all four items.&#39;]

agents: [&#39;CoT Agent 1, on the purpose of calculating residents owning at least one item, thinking: We are given the number of residents owning each of the three items and the number owning exactly two or three items. We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the number of residents owning at least one of the items. Let A be the set of residents owning a diamond ring, B be the set owning golf clubs, and C be the set owning a garden spade. We need to find |A ∪ B ∪ C|.

The inclusion-exclusion principle calculation already accounts for those owning exactly three items, so the 234 residents who own exactly three of the items are already included in the 921 total. Therefore, the number of residents owning exactly three of the three items is directly given as 234.; answer: 234\nCoT Agent 4.2.1, on the purpose of initial calculation of residents owning three items, thinking: We have the total number of residents owning at least one of the three items as 921. Among these, 437 own exactly two items, and 234 own exactly three items. The 234 residents who own exactly three items are already accounted for in the 921 total, as are those owning exactly two items. Therefore, the number of residents owning three items is simply the 234 residents who own exactly three of the three items, as given in sub-task 3.; answer: 234\nCritic Agent 4.2.1, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The calculation correctly identifies that the 234 residents who own exactly three items are distinct and should be considered as owning all three of the non-candy items. Since the total number of residents owning at least one of the three non-candy items is 921, and 437 own exactly two items, the 234 owning exactly three items are accounted for correctly.; answer: Yes\nCoT Agent 4.2.1, on the purpose of refining calculation, thinking: The task is to determine the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. We know that 234 residents own exactly three of the non-candy items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). Since each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, these 234 residents are the ones who own all four items. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 234.; answer: 234\nCritic Agent 4.2.1, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The calculation provided assumes that the 234 residents who own exactly three of the non-candy items are the same as those who own all four items, including the candy hearts. Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, owning three of the non-candy items implies owning all four items. Therefore, the answer is correct.; answer: The reasoning and conclusion that 234 residents own all four items, including the candy hearts, are correct.\nCoT Agent 4.2.1, on the purpose of refining calculation, thinking: The task is to determine the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;The current architecture still fails to solve all sub-tasks correctly, particularly sub-task 4.2.2, which contains &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This indicates that the task is still too difficult and requires further decomposition. The architecture needs to address the complexity of the inclusion-exclusion principle and ensure all calculations are accurate.&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks are not adequately covering all necessary information to yield a comprehensive answer. Connections between sub-tasks are not clear enough, leading to errors in the final aggregation.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The low fitness score shows that the final response is incorrect. The architecture and decomposition must be revised to improve the fitness score.&#39;}

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
To improve solvability, further break down sub-task 4.2.2:

- Last sub-task 4.2.2 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4.2.2.1: Re-evaluate the inclusion-exclusion principle calculations for owning all four items.
- New sub-task 4.2.2.2: Verify the calculations using an alternative method to ensure accuracy.

This further decomposition ensures each sub-task is more focused and easier for the blocks to handle, increasing the likelihood of accurate outputs.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
Last sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 4.2.2) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (Reflexion for sub-task 4.2.2.1 and CoT for sub-task 4.2.2.2). The main difference is using Reflexion to iteratively refine the calculations, providing a more accurate input for the final verification in sub-task 4.2.2.2.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For sub-task 4.2.2.2, add: &#34;It is known that 234 is not correct.&#34; to avoid repeating the same mistake.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;The current architecture struggles with solvability, especially for sub-tasks that require the inclusion-exclusion principle. Sub-tasks 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 both contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating that they need further decomposition. The architecture is not effectively addressing the complexity of these calculations, suggesting a need for further refinement.&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks are missing critical information needed to apply the inclusion-exclusion principle accurately. Specifically, the pairwise intersection counts are not provided, which prevents accurate calculation of the required values.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score remains low because the final response is incorrect. The architecture and decomposition need to be revised to ensure that all necessary information is included and that the calculations are accurate.&#39;}

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
To improve solvability, we need to further decompose sub-task 4.2.2.1:

- Last sub-task 4.2.2.1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4.2.2.1.1: Identify and calculate pairwise intersections of residents owning two items.
- New sub-task 4.2.2.1.2: Use the pairwise intersections to apply the inclusion-exclusion principle effectively.

This further decomposition ensures that each sub-task is more focused and easier for the blocks to handle, increasing the likelihood of accurate outputs.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
Last sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 4.2.2.1) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (Reflexion for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1 and CoT for sub-task 4.2.2.1.2). The main difference is using Reflexion to iteratively refine the pairwise intersection calculations, providing a more accurate input for the final calculation in sub-task 4.2.2.1.2.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For sub-task 4.2.2.1.2, add: &#34;It is known that 234 and 300 are not correct.&#34; to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - We need to calculate the number of residents owning at least one of the three items: diamond ring, golf clubs, or garden spade. We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to do this. We are given the number of residents who own each item: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. We are also given the number of residents who own exactly two of these items (437) and exactly three of these items (234). Using inclusion-exclusion, we calculate: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|. We know |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234, and |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 2*234 = 905. Thus, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 905 + 234.; answer - 453\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - We are given that 437 residents own exactly two of the three items. This is direct information from the problem statement, so we do not need to calculate anything further for this sub-task.; answer - 437\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - We are given that 234 residents own exactly three of these items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). This is direct information from the problem statement, so we do not need to calculate anything further for this sub-task.; answer - 234\nSub-task 4.2.2.1.1 output: thinking - The task is to find individual pairwise intersections of residents owning two items. We know the total number of residents owning exactly two items is 437, and those owning all three items is 234. The sum of the pairwise intersections is 905. However, without specific data on how many residents own each pairwise combination of two items, it is not possible to determine each pairwise intersection uniquely. This problem lacks specific constraints or data to solve for each intersection uniquely.; answer - 905\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide specific numbers for residents owning exactly two specific items, or additional constraints that can help solve for each pairwise intersection uniquely.\nSub-task 4.2.2.1.2 output: thinking - We need to use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the number of residents owning all four items. We know the total number of residents owning exactly two items is 437, and those owning exactly three items is 234. The total number of residents is 900, and each owns a bag of candy hearts. However, without specific data on pairwise intersections or constraints, it&#39;s difficult to calculate the exact number owning all four items. The problem lacks specific data to determine the intersections uniquely.; answer - 300\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide specific numbers for residents owning exactly two specific items, or additional constraints that can help solve the intersections uniquely.&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT Agent 1, on the purpose of calculating residents owning at least one item, thinking: We need to calculate the number of residents owning at least one of the three items: diamond ring, golf clubs, or garden spade. We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to do this. We are given the number of residents who own each item: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. We are also given the number of residents who own exactly two of these items (437) and exactly three of these items (234). Using inclusion-exclusion, we calculate: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|. We know |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234, and |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 2*234 = 905. Thus, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 195 + 367 + 562 - 905 + 234.; answer: 453\nCoT Agent 2, on the purpose of calculating residents owning exactly two items, thinking: We are given that 437 residents own exactly two of the three items. This is direct information from the problem statement, so we do not need to calculate anything further for this sub-task.; answer: 437\nCoT Agent 3, on the purpose of calculating residents owning exactly three items, thinking: We are given that 234 residents own exactly three of these items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). This is direct information from the problem statement, so we do not need to calculate anything further for this sub-task.; answer: 234\nCoT Agent 4.2.2.1.1, on the purpose of initial calculation of pairwise intersections, thinking: We need to calculate the pairwise intersections |A ∩ B|, |A ∩ C|, and |B ∩ C|. We know that the total number of residents owning exactly two items is 437, and the number owning all three items is 234. Thus, |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 2*234 = 905. This equation comes from the fact that each resident owning all three items is counted three times in the pairwise intersections. However, without additional information about the distribution of these intersections, it is not possible to uniquely determine each pairwise intersection value.; answer: 905\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide additional information about the distribution of residents owning exactly two specific items, or use specific constraints to solve for each pairwise intersection uniquely.\nCritic Agent 4.2.2.1.1, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The calculation of the pairwise intersections used the total number of residents owning exactly two items and those owning exactly three items to form an equation. However, it is not possible to uniquely determine each pairwise intersection value without additional information.; answer: The equation |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 905 is correct given the available information, but it does not allow for unique determination of each pairwise intersection.\nCoT Agent 4.2.2.1.1, on the purpose of refining calculation, thinking: The problem involves finding the individual pairwise intersections of residents owning two items. We have the total number of residents owning exactly two items (437) and those owning all three items (234). The sum of the pairwise intersections is given by |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 2*234 = 905. However, without additional constraints or information about the distribution of residents owning exactly two specific items, it is not possible to uniquely determine each pairwise intersection. The problem requires more specific data to solve for each intersection uniquely.; answer: 905\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide specific numbers for residents owning exactly two specific items, or additional constraints that can help solve for each pairwise intersection uniquely.\nCritic Agent 4.2.2.1.1, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The calculation of the sum of pairwise intersections as 905 is correct given the information provided. However, without specific data on how many residents own each pairwise combination of two items, it is impossible to determine the individual pairwise intersections uniquely. The problem lacks sufficient constraints or information to decompose further.; answer: The sum of pairwise intersections is 905, but additional constraints or specific data are needed to solve for each intersection uniquely.\nCoT Agent 4.2.2.1.1, on the purpose of refining calculation, thinking: The problem requires determining individual pairwise intersections of residents owning two items, but we only have the total count of 437 residents owning exactly two items and 234 owning all three. The sum of pairwise intersections is 905, but without additional specific information on how many residents own each pairwise combination, we cannot uniquely determine each intersection. This is a classic case of needing more constraints or specific data to solve the problem uniquely.; answer: 905\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Provide specific numbers for residents owning exactly two specific items, or additional constraints that can help solve for each pairwise intersection uniquely.\nCritic Agent 4.2.2.1.1, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The calculation of pairwise intersections is incomplete due to insufficient data. We know the total number of residents owning exactly two items is 437, but without specific counts for each combination of two items, we cannot accurately determine the pairwise intersections.; answer: The sum of pairwise intersections is 905, but the lack of specific data makes it impossible to find each intersection uniquely.\nCoT Agent 4.2.2.1.1, on the purpose of refining calculation, thinking: The task is to find individual pairwise intersections of residents owning two items.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;The current architecture still faces solvability issues, particularly with sub-tasks that require the inclusion-exclusion principle. Sub-tasks 4.2.2.1.1 and 4.2.2.1.2 both contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating they need further decomposition or more specific data. The architecture is not effectively addressing the complexity of these calculations, which suggests a need for further refinement.&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks are missing critical information needed to apply the inclusion-exclusion principle accurately. Specifically, the pairwise intersection counts are not provided, which prevents accurate calculation of the required values.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score remains low because the final response is incorrect. The architecture and decomposition need to be revised to ensure that all necessary information is included and that the calculations are accurate.&#39;}

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
To improve solvability, we need to further decompose sub-task 4.2.2.1.1:

- Last sub-task 4.2.2.1.1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1: Calculate the number of residents owning each pair of items individually.
- New sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.2: Use the calculated pairwise counts to deduce the overall intersections more effectively.

This further decomposition ensures that each sub-task is more focused and easier for the blocks to handle, increasing the likelihood of accurate outputs.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
Last sub-task architecture (Reflexion for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1 and Reflexion for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.2). The main difference is using CoT to calculate individual pairwise counts first, then refining the overall intersection calculation with Reflexion.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.2, add: &#34;It is known that 234 and 300 are not correct.&#34; to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;The current architecture continues to struggle with solvability, particularly with tasks that require the inclusion-exclusion principle. Sub-tasks 4.2.2.1.1.1 and 4.2.2.1.1.2 both contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating they need further decomposition or more specific data. The architecture is not effectively addressing the complexity of these calculations, suggesting a need for further refinement.

The architecture and decomposition need to be revised to ensure that all necessary information is included and that the calculations are accurate.&#39;}

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
To improve solvability, we need to further decompose sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1:

- Last sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1: Calculate the number of residents owning each specific pair of items (diamond ring &amp; golf clubs, diamond ring &amp; garden spade, golf clubs &amp; garden spade) using additional assumptions or constraints.
- New sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.2: Verify the calculated pairwise counts against known constraints to ensure accuracy.

This further decomposition ensures that each sub-task is more focused and easier for the blocks to handle, increasing the likelihood of accurate outputs.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
Last sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1 and Reflexion for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.2). The main difference is using CoT to make initial assumptions about pairwise counts, then refining these assumptions with Reflexion.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.2, add: &#34;It is known that 234 and 300 are not correct.&#34; to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can calculate the number of residents who own at least one of these items. We also know there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these items and 234 who own all three. Therefore, the number of residents owning at least one item is given by the formula: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;The architecture still struggles with solvability, especially for tasks requiring the inclusion-exclusion principle. Sub-tasks 4.2.2.1.1.1.1 and 4.2.2.1.1.1.2 both contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating they need further decomposition or more specific data. The architecture is not effectively addressing the complexity of these calculations, suggesting a need for further refinement. The agents are unable to provide a correct breakdown of residents owning specific pairs of items due to insufficient data.&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks are missing critical information needed to apply the inclusion-exclusion principle accurately. Specifically, the pairwise intersection counts are not provided, which prevents accurate calculation of the required values.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score remains low because the final response is incorrect. The architecture and decomposition need to be revised to ensure that all necessary information is included and that the calculations are accurate.&#39;}

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
To improve solvability, we need to further decompose sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1:

- Last sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1: Use known constraints to estimate each pairwise intersection.
- New sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.2: Validate these estimates against the problem constraints.

This further decomposition ensures that each sub-task is more focused and easier for the blocks to handle, increasing the likelihood of accurate outputs.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
Last sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1 and Reflexion for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.2). The main difference is using CoT to estimate pairwise intersections, then refining these estimates with Reflexion.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.2, add: &#34;It is known that 234 and 300 are not correct.&#34; to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

We know |A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562, |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234, and |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 2 * 234 to account for those owning exactly two of the items. Solving gives us the number owning at least one.; answer - 790\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - From sub-task 1, we know that 790 residents own at least one of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). We are given that 437 residents own exactly two of these items, and 234 residents own all three. To find the number owning exactly two, we need to account for those owning all three, as they are included in the count of those owning at least two. Since 437 residents own exactly two and 234 own all three, the number owning exactly two of the three items is simply 437, as this is the number given for exactly two items without needing further adjustment.; answer - 437\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - In sub-task 1, we calculated that 790 residents own at least one of the three items. In sub-task 2, it was confirmed that 437 residents own exactly two of the three items. We are given that 234 residents own all three items. The number of residents owning exactly three of the three items is already given as 234. There is no further calculation needed to find the number of residents owning exactly three of the three items because it was directly provided in the problem statement.; answer - 234\nSub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1 output: thinking - We need to estimate the pairwise intersections |A ∩ B|, |A ∩ C|, and |B ∩ C|. We know that the total number of residents owning at least one of the three items is 790, and that 437 own exactly two of these items, while 234 own all three. The sum of pairwise intersections |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| includes those owning exactly two items plus twice those owning all three. Therefore, |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 2 * 234 = 905. However, this total exceeds the number of residents owning at least one item (790), indicating a need for adjustment or further decomposition to estimate each pairwise intersection accurately.; answer - 905\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Break down each pairwise intersection calculation separately using additional constraints or assumptions.\nSub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.2 output: thinking - The task involves calculating the number of residents who own all four items, given the constraints on ownership of exactly two or three items.

The sum of pairwise intersections |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| includes those owning exactly two items plus twice those owning all three. Therefore, |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 + 2 * 234 = 905.

From the previous sub-task, the sum of the pairwise intersections was calculated as 905, which exceeds the total number of residents owning at least one item (790). This indicates an inconsistency. The problem constraints indicate that 234 residents own exactly three items, and 437 own exactly two items. The sum of the pairwise intersections should account for those owning exactly two items plus twice those owning all three, which was calculated as 905, but this conflicts with the total of 790. Therefore, we need to adjust the estimates for each pairwise intersection to fit within the total of 790 while still satisfying the conditions for those owning exactly two and exactly three items. Since 234 and 300 were mentioned as incorrect, the estimates need to be reassessed.; answer: 905\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Recalculate each pairwise intersection individually using the constraints of 437 owning exactly two items and 234 owning all three, ensuring the total does not exceed 790.\nCritic Agent 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.2, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The validation identified an inconsistency with the pairwise intersection estimates exceeding the total number of residents owning at least one item. The suggestion to recalculate the pairwise intersections individually is appropriate to ensure the estimates fit the constraints.; answer: The feedback correctly identifies the issue with the initial estimates and suggests a reasonable approach to address it.\nCoT Agent 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.2, on the purpose of refining calculation, thinking: The problem involves estimating pairwise intersections of residents owning different items, with constraints on the total number owning at least one item, exactly two items, and exactly three items. Previous attempts suggested recalculating pairwise intersections individually to fit within the total of 790 residents owning at least one item. However, the task is complex due to the overlapping nature of ownership, and the need to refine estimates based on given constraints.; answer: 790\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Recalculate each pairwise intersection using the constraints of 437 owning exactly two items and 234 owning all three, ensuring the total does not exceed 790.\nCritic Agent 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.2, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The validation of pairwise intersection estimates needs to ensure consistency with the constraints provided, such as the number of residents owning exactly two or three items.

The previous attempts indicated that the sum of the pairwise intersections was 905, which exceeds the total of 790 residents who own at least one item. This suggests a need for a more precise breakdown of the intersections. However, the problem is complex due to the overlapping nature of ownership and the need to balance the constraints provided. Without additional specific breakdowns or constraints, such as individual pairwise intersection values, it&#39;s challenging to refine the calculation accurately.; answer: 790\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Recalculate each pairwise intersection using the constraints of 437 owning exactly two items and 234 owning all three, ensuring the total does not exceed 790.

Ensure that the sum of residents owning exactly two items and those owning exactly three items matches the constraints given.; answer: The sum of pairwise intersections was incorrectly calculated as 905, which is greater than the total number of residents owning at least one item, 790.

Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;The current architecture continues to face solvability issues, particularly with tasks requiring the inclusion-exclusion principle. Sub-tasks 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1 and 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.2 contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;, indicating they need further decomposition or more specific data. The architecture is not effectively addressing the complexity of these calculations, suggesting a need for further refinement. The agents are unable to provide a correct breakdown of residents owning specific pairs of items due to insufficient data.&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks are missing critical information needed to apply the inclusion-exclusion principle accurately. Specifically, the pairwise intersection counts are not provided, which prevents accurate calculation of the required values.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score remains low because the final response is incorrect. The architecture and decomposition need to be revised to ensure that all necessary information is included and that the calculations are accurate.&#39;}

thought: 
**Further Decomposition:**
To improve solvability, we need to further decompose sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1:

- Last sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.1: Calculate the number of residents owning each pair of items separately, considering additional constraints or assumptions.
- New sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.2: Validate these calculations against the known constraints to ensure accuracy.

This further decomposition ensures that each sub-task is more focused and easier for the blocks to handle, increasing the likelihood of accurate outputs.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
Last sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1) -&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architecture (CoT for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.1 and Reflexion for sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.2). The main difference is using CoT to calculate pairwise intersections, then refining these calculations with Reflexion.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For sub-task 4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.2, add: &#34;It is known that 234, 300, and 790 are not correct.&#34; to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
