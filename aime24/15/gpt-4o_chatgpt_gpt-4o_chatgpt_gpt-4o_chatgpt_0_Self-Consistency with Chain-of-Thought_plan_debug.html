    <pre>We are given the number of residents in Aimeville and the counts of those who own different combinations of items. We need to find the number of residents who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts.

First, we note that every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so we focus on the other three items: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spade (S).

Let |D|, |G|, |S| be the number of residents who own a diamond ring, golf clubs, and a garden spade, respectively. We are given:
|D| = 195
|G| = 367
|S| = 562

Let |D and G and S| be the number of residents who own all three items, which is given as 234.

Let |D and G|, |G and S|, |S and D| be the number of residents who own exactly two of the three items. We are given that the total number of residents who own exactly two of these three items is 437.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
|D or G or S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D and G| - |G and S| - |S and D| + |D and G and S|

We know that 437 residents own exactly two items, so:
|D and G| + |G and S| + |S and D| = 437.

Also, we have:
|D or G or S| = 900 (since each resident owns at least one item, the total is 900).

Substitute the known values:
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 + 234

Solve for the number of residents who own all four items (which is the same as those who own all three items, since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts):

195 + 367 + 562 = 1124
1124 - 437 = 687
687 + 234 = 921

But this is incorrect, as it exceeds the total number of residents. The error is in adding the excess from the three-item owners.

Instead, we directly calculate the number of residents who own all four items by considering the overlap of owning all three items, as they all own candy hearts.

Since 234 own all three items, and everyone owns candy hearts, the number of residents who own all four items is simply those who own all three items, which is 234 residents.
