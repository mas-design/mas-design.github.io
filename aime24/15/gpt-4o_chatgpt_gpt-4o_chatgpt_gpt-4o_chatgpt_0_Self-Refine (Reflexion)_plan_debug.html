    <pre>We are given the total number of residents (900) and the number of residents who own each specific item: diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), and garden spades (562). Additionally, every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. We know that 437 residents own exactly two of the items (excluding the candy hearts), and 234 own exactly three of the items (including the candy hearts). We want to find the number of residents who own all four items.

Let&#39;s use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of residents who own at least one of the three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade). Let A be the set of residents who own a diamond ring, B be the set of residents who own golf clubs, and C be the set of residents who own a garden spade.

The principle of inclusion-exclusion gives us:
|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

We know:
|A| = 195
|B| = 367
|C| = 562

We also know:
|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| = 437 (since these are the people who own exactly two items)
|A ∩ B ∩ C| = 234 (since these are the people who own all three items)

We want to find the number of people who own all four items, which is |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|, where D is the set of people who own candy hearts. Since everyone owns candy hearts, |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D| = |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is simply |A ∩ B ∩ C|, which is 234.
