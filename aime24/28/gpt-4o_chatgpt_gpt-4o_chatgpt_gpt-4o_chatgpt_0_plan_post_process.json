The radii r_i and r_o are not simply the minor radius of the torus. They are the radii of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere. \n\nLet's correct this: \n\nFor the externally tangent on the outside (r_o):\n- The center of the torus is at a distance of 17 from the center of the sphere.\n- The circle of tangency is at the outer edge of the torus, which means the radius of the circle of tangency is R + r - 11 = 6 + 3 - 11 = -2. This doesn't make sense, as radii cannot be negative, so I must have made a mistake here. Let us reconsider the geometry.\n\nFor the externally tangent on the inside (r_i):\n- The center of the torus is at a distance of 5 from the center of the sphere.\n- The circle of tangency is at the inner edge of the torus, which means the radius of the circle of tangency is 11 - (6 - 3) = 11 - 3 = 8.\n\nI need to correct my previous assumptions. I will calculate the difference based on the correct understanding of the geometry.\n\nWe have two cases:\n\n1. **Externally Tangent on the Outside:**\n   - The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is 17.\n   - The circle of tangency radius is the distance from the center of the tube to the tangent point, which is 17 - 11 = 6.\n\n2. **Externally Tangent on the Inside:**\n   - The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is 5.\n   - The circle of tangency radius is the distance from the center of the tube to the tangent point, which is 11 - 5 = 8.\n\nThe difference r_i - r_o = 8 - 6 = 2.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for m + n where the difference is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms. Here, the difference is 2, which is 2/1, so m = 2 and n = 1. Therefore, m + n = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nAnswer:3"
