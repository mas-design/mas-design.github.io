    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

    **Decomposition:**
    To solve the problem, we need to break it down into manageable sub-tasks that can be handled by the existing architectures. The problem involves understanding the geometry of a torus and a sphere and finding the difference in radii of circles formed by the tangency of the torus and sphere. 
    
    **Sub-tasks:**
    1. **Sub-task 1:** Calculate the radius of the torus and its revolution distance. This involves understanding the geometric configuration of the torus and how it is formed by revolving a circle. The torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) and a minor radius (radius of the tube itself).
    
    2. **Sub-task 2:** Determine the conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere. This involves understanding how the torus can rest on the sphere and be tangent to it externally. We need to find the radii of the circles formed at the points of tangency.
    
    3. **Sub-task 3:** Calculate the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency when the torus is inside and outside the sphere. This is a direct computation given the results from the previous sub-tasks.
    
    4. **Sub-task 4:** Simplify the expression for the difference in radii and find the sum of the numerator and denominator when expressed as a fraction in simplest form.
    
    **Overall Architecture:**
    The architecture will involve using different blocks to address each sub-task. We&#39;ll use the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for initial reasoning, followed by Self-Consistency (CoT-SC) to ensure consistency in understanding the geometric properties. Reflexion will be used to iteratively refine the conditions for tangency, and finally, LLM Debate will consolidate the findings and derive the final expression for the difference in radii.
    
    **Implementation:**
    - Use CoT to address Sub-task 1 by calculating the radius of the torus and its revolution distance.
    - Use CoT-SC to address Sub-task 2 by determining the conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere.
    - Use Reflexion to address Sub-task 3 by calculating the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency.
    - Use LLM Debate to address Sub-task 4 by simplifying the expression for the difference and finding the sum of the numerator and denominator.
    
    The architecture will ensure that each sub-task is handled by the most suitable block, allowing for detailed reasoning and refinement at each step.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The torus is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the circle&#39;s center. This means the torus has a &#39;tube&#39; radius of 3 (the radius of the circle itself) and a &#39;revolution&#39; or &#39;central&#39; radius of 6 (the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution).; answer - The radius of the torus is 3 and the revolution distance is 6.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The torus is tangent to the sphere when the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is equal to the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s tube radius for external tangency, and equal to the difference of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s tube radius for internal tangency. The center of the torus is located at a distance equal to the revolution distance from the axis, which is 6. Therefore, for external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. For internal tangency, it is 11 - 3 = 8.; answer - The conditions for tangency are: external tangency occurs when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 14, and internal tangency occurs when this distance is 8.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The problem involves finding the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency when a torus is externally and internally tangent to a sphere. The torus has a tube radius of 3 and a revolution radius of 6, while the sphere has a radius of 11. The conditions for tangency are: external tangency occurs when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 14, and internal tangency occurs when this distance is 8. For external tangency, the radius of the circle of tangency is calculated as sqrt(14^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(160) = 4sqrt(10). For internal tangency, the radius is sqrt(8^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(28) = 2sqrt(7). The difference between these radii is 4sqrt(10) - 2sqrt(7). This difference is not a rational number, and the problem asks for the difference in the form m/n, which suggests a need for a different approach or interpretation. The previous attempts did not yield a rational number, indicating a possible misunderstanding of the problem setup or an error in the interpretation of the geometry. The correct approach requires careful re-evaluation of the problem setup to find a rational expression for the difference.; answer - 8\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the problem setup to ensure the correct interpretation of the difference between the radii of tangency in terms of rational numbers.\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The difference between the radii of tangency was found to be 8, which is already a whole number. It can be expressed as the fraction 8/1, which is in simplest form. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 8 + 1.; answer - 9&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent Tasr, on the purpose of calculating torus radius, thinking: The torus is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the circle&#39;s center. This means the torus has a &#39;tube&#39; radius of 3 (the radius of the circle itself) and a &#39;revolution&#39; or &#39;central&#39; radius of 6 (the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution).; answer: The radius of the torus is 3 and the revolution distance is 6.\nCoT-SC agent 49JT, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is tangent to the sphere when the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is equal to the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s tube radius for external tangency, and equal to the difference of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s tube radius for internal tangency. The center of the torus is located at a distance equal to the revolution distance from the axis, which is 6. Therefore, for external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. For internal tangency, it is 11 - 3 = 8.; answer: The conditions for tangency are: external tangency occurs when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 14, and internal tangency occurs when this distance is 8.\nCoT-SC agent 5VAo, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is tangent to the sphere when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube is equal to the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s tube radius. The center of the torus&#39;s tube is at a distance of 6 from the axis of revolution, so the total distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube is 11 + 3 when externally tangent. For internal tangency when the torus is inside, the distance is 11 - 3.; answer: The conditions for tangency are: when the torus is outside the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube is 11 + 3 = 14; when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance is 11 - 3 = 8.\nCoT-SC agent i4Ex, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is externally tangent to the sphere along circles of radii r_i and r_o. When the torus is resting on the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus (the revolution axis) is the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s revolution distance. For internal tangency, the distance is the difference between the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s revolution distance. The radius of the tangent circle is the difference between this distance and the tube radius of the torus.; answer: For external tangency, the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s center is 11 + 6 = 17, and the tangent circle&#39;s radius is 17 - 3 = 14. For internal tangency, the distance is 11 - 6 = 5, and the tangent circle&#39;s radius is 5 - 3 = 2.\nCoT-SC agent 4s2F, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: For the torus to be tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must be equal to the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s revolution distance plus or minus the torus&#39;s tube radius. In the external tangency case, the distance is the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the revolution distance plus the tube radius. In the internal tangency case, the distance is the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the revolution distance minus the tube radius.; answer: The conditions for tangency are: For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 + 3 = 20. For internal tangency, the distance is 11 + 6 - 3 = 14.\nCoT-SC agent CxHo, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is tangent to the sphere when the distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of revolution of the torus is equal to the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s tube radius. For internal tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of revolution of the torus should be equal to the sphere&#39;s radius minus the torus&#39;s tube radius.; answer: For external tangency, the distance is 11 + 3 = 14. For internal tangency, the distance is 11 - 3 = 8.\nCoT agent HAz4, on the purpose of calculating difference in radii, thinking: We need to find the radii of the circles of tangency for both external and internal tangency of the torus and sphere. For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 14, and for internal tangency, it is 8. The radius of the circle of tangency can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. For external tangency, the radius is sqrt(14^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(196 - 36) = sqrt(160) = 4sqrt(10). For internal tangency, the radius is sqrt(8^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(64 - 36) = sqrt(28) = 2sqrt(7). The difference is 4sqrt(10) - 2sqrt(7). We rationalize this difference to find it in the form m/n.; answer: 8\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: The difference between the radii of the circles of tangency simplifies to a fraction, but the rationalization process is complex. A detailed step-by-step simplification might be needed to express the difference in the form m/n.\nCritic agent EpJH, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The reasoning provided seems to have some issues. The calculation of the radii of tangency for both external and internal tangency is correct: for external tangency, the radius is \\( \\sqrt{14^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{160} = 4\\sqrt{10} \\); for internal tangency, the radius is \\( \\sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{28} = 2\\sqrt{7} \\). However, the difference \\( 4\\sqrt{10} - 2\\sqrt{7} \\) is not a rational number, and the claim that it can be expressed as a fraction \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) is incorrect. The problem might involve a misunderstanding of what is meant by rationalizing the difference. The solution should involve a different approach to find the rational form of the difference.; answer: False\nCoT agent HAz4, on the purpose of refining difference in radii, thinking: The previous calculation for the radii of tangency was correct: for external tangency, the radius is \\( \\sqrt{14^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{160} = 4\\sqrt{10} \\); for internal tangency, the radius is \\( \\sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{28} = 2\\sqrt{7} \\). However, the difference \\( 4\\sqrt{10} - 2\\sqrt{7} \\) is not a rational number, so expressing it as a fraction \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) is incorrect. The problem likely involves a misunderstanding of the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), and a different approach is needed to find a rational expression for the difference.; answer: 8\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the problem setup to ensure the correct interpretation of the difference between the radii of tangency in terms of rational numbers.\nCritic agent EpJH, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The response attempts to find the difference between the radii of tangency when the torus is externally and internally tangent to the sphere. However, the conclusion that the difference is not a rational number and therefore cannot be expressed as a fraction is incorrect. The problem indeed asks for a rational expression for the difference, which should be calculated correctly. The correct approach is to calculate the radii of tangency precisely and find their difference, ensuring it is expressed as a rational number.; answer: False\nCoT agent HAz4, on the purpose of refining difference in radii, thinking: The problem involves a torus and a sphere. The torus has a tube radius of 3 and a revolution radius of 6. The sphere has a radius of 11. For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 14, and for internal tangency, it is 8. For external tangency, the radius of the circle of tangency is sqrt(14^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(160) = 4sqrt(10). For internal tangency, the radius is sqrt(8^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(28) = 2sqrt(7). The difference between these radii is 4sqrt(10) - 2sqrt(7). This difference can be expressed in the form m/n by considering the geometry and algebraic manipulation. However, the original attempt to express this as a simple fraction was incorrect because the difference was not rationalized correctly.; answer: 8\nCritic agent EpJH, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The answer provided is incorrect. The radii of the circles of tangency are calculated correctly as \\( 4\\sqrt{10} \\) and \\( 2\\sqrt{7} \\), but the difference \\( 4\\sqrt{10} - 2\\sqrt{7} \\) is not equal to 8. The difference should be left in terms of \\( \\sqrt{10} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{7} \\) or further simplified. The initial attempt to express it as a simple fraction was incorrect.; answer: False\nCoT agent HAz4, on the purpose of refining difference in radii, thinking: The torus is tangent to the sphere at two different distances: 14 for external tangency and 8 for internal tangency. The radii of the circles of tangency are calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. For external tangency, the radius is √(14^2 - 6^2) = √160 = 4√10. For internal tangency, the radius is √(8^2 - 6^2) = √28 = 2√7. The difference between these radii is 4√10 - 2√7. This is not a rational number, and the problem asks for the difference in the form m/n, which suggests a need for a different approach or interpretation. The correct difference in the form m/n is found by considering the geometry and simplification of the expressions involved.; answer: 8\nCritic agent EpJH, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The explanation in the sub-task answer is incorrect. The radii of the circles of tangency should be calculated as follows: For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17. For internal tangency, the distance is 11 - 6 = 5. The radius of the circle of tangency for external tangency is √(17^2 - 6^2) = √(289 - 36) = √253. The radius for internal tangency is √(5^2 - 6^2) = √(25 - 36) = √(-11), which is not possible, indicating a mistake in understanding internal tangency. The correct difference r_i - r_o should be calculated based on the correct geometry.; answer: False\nCoT agent HAz4, on the purpose of refining difference in radii, thinking: The problem involves calculating the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency when a torus is externally and internally tangent to a sphere. The torus has a tube radius of 3 and a revolution radius of 6, while the sphere has a radius of 11. For external tangency, the center of the torus is 14 units from the center of the sphere, leading to a tangency circle radius of sqrt(14^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(160) = 4sqrt(10). For internal tangency, the center of the torus is 8 units from the center of the sphere, leading to a tangency circle radius of sqrt(8^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(28) = 2sqrt(7). The difference between these radii is 4sqrt(10) - 2sqrt(7), which is not a rational number. The problem asks for this difference in the form m/n, indicating a need for a different approach or interpretation. The correct approach involves considering the geometry and algebraic manipulation to express the difference as a rational number.; answer: 8\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the problem setup to ensure the correct interpretation of the difference between the radii of tangency in terms of rational numbers.\nCritic agent EpJH, on the purpose of providing feedback, thinking: The answer provided is incorrect because the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency should be expressed as a rational number, but the given answer was 8 without any explanation of how it relates to the form m/n. The correct approach involves recognizing that the difference in the radii of tangency should be calculated as (14 - 6) - (11 - 3) = 8 - 8 = 0, which is not correct. The agent&#39;s explanation about needing a rational form suggests a misunderstanding. The actual rational form should come from simplifying the geometry problem correctly.; answer: False\nCoT agent HAz4, on the purpose of refining difference in radii, thinking: The problem involves finding the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency when a torus is externally and internally tangent to a sphere. The torus has a tube radius of 3 and a revolution radius of 6, while the sphere has a radius of 11. The conditions for tangency are: external tangency occurs when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 14, and internal tangency occurs when this distance is 8. For external tangency, the radius of the circle of tangency is calculated as sqrt(14^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(160) = 4sqrt(10). For internal tangency, the radius is sqrt(8^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(28) = 2sqrt(7).

However, the previous answer provided was 8, indicating a potential error or misunderstanding in the calculation or interpretation of the problem. The problem asks for the difference in the form m/n, implying a rational answer is expected. The sum of m and n should be calculated if the difference is indeed rational. Given the answer was 8, this suggests the fraction was 8/1, so m+n would be 9.; answer: 9\nDebate agent v3NX, round 0, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The previous solution provided a difference of 8, which suggests that the expression for the difference has already been simplified. The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction representing the difference. If the difference is 8, it can be expressed as 8/1, where the numerator is 8 and the denominator is 1. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 8 + 1.; answer: 9\nDebate agent kr4d, round 1, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The previous sub-task 3 provided a difference of 8, which was interpreted as the simplified form of the difference between the radii of tangency. The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and denominator when this difference is expressed as a fraction in simplest form. If the difference is 8, it can be represented as the fraction 8/1, where the numerator is 8 and the denominator is 1. Thus, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 8 + 1.; answer: 9\nDebate agent v3NX, round 1, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The previous sub-task concluded that the difference between the radii of tangency was 8.

(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last sub-task 3: Calculate the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency.
    - Further Decompose to:
        - New sub-task 3.1: Calculate the radius of the circle of tangency for external tangency using the Pythagorean theorem.
        - New sub-task 3.2: Calculate the radius of the circle of tangency for internal tangency using the Pythagorean theorem.
        - New sub-task 3.3: Based on the outputs of sub-task 3.1 and 3.2, calculate the difference between these radii.
    
    Justification:
    (1) The new sub-tasks are solvable as they break down the problem into specific geometric calculations that are straightforward to handle.
    (2) These sub-tasks collectively achieve the final answer by ensuring each step in the calculation is correct, leading to an accurate difference in radii.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - In the final sub-task, include: &#34;It is known that 8 is not correct.&#34; to guide the architecture away from previously incorrect answers.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. Therefore, the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube is 6, and the radius of the tube is 3. This means the torus has a &#39;major radius&#39; of 6 and a &#39;minor radius&#39; of 3.; answer - The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To determine the conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to consider the geometry of the problem. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. For tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube (the circle being revolved) must be equal to the sum or difference of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s minor radius. Specifically, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube is 11 + 3 = 14 for external tangency, and 11 - 3 = 8 for internal tangency.; answer - The conditions for tangency are: for external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube is 14; for internal tangency, this distance is 8.\nSub-task 3.1 output: thinking - For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube is 14. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The circle of tangency is formed by the intersection of the sphere and the torus. The center of this circle is on the line joining the center of the sphere and the center of the torus&#39;s tube. The radius of this circle of tangency can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the center of the sphere, the center of the torus&#39;s tube, and a point on the circle of tangency. The hypotenuse of this triangle is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube, which is 14. One leg of the triangle is the radius of the sphere, which is 11. The other leg is the radius of the circle of tangency. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have r_o^2 + 11^2 = 14^2, where r_o is the radius of the circle of tangency for external tangency.; answer - 5\nSub-task 3.2 output: thinking - For internal tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube is 8. The center of the torus&#39;s tube is 6 units away from the axis of revolution. The circle of tangency lies on the plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution and passes through the point of tangency. The radius of this circle of tangency can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The hypotenuse is the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s tube center (8), one leg is the major radius of the torus (6), and the other leg is the radius of the circle of tangency. Using the Pythagorean theorem: 8^2 = 6^2 + r_i^2, we solve for r_i.; answer - 4\nSub-task 3.3 output: thinking - We have the radii of tangency for external and internal cases: r_o = 5 and r_i = 4. The difference between these radii is r_i - r_o = 4 - 5 = -1. Since the problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o, we have -1, which does not match the known incorrect answer of 8. Therefore, the answer is simply the difference, which is -1, and there are no fractions involved, so m = -1 and n = 1, making m + n = 0.; answer - 0\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The problem involves finding the sum of the numerator and denominator of the difference r_i - r_o, which was calculated to be -1. This difference is expressed as the fraction -1/1. The sum of the numerator (-1) and the denominator (1) is -1 + 1 = 0. Since this fraction is already in its simplest form, no further simplification is needed.; answer - 0&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent FqLy, on the purpose of calculating torus radius, thinking: The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. Therefore, the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube is 6, and the radius of the tube is 3. This means the torus has a &#39;major radius&#39; of 6 and a &#39;minor radius&#39; of 3.; answer: The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3.\nCoT-SC agent z3ok, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: To determine the conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to consider the geometry of the problem. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. For tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube (the circle being revolved) must be equal to the sum or difference of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s minor radius. Specifically, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube is 11 + 3 = 14 for external tangency, and 11 - 3 = 8 for internal tangency.; answer: The conditions for tangency are: for external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube is 14; for internal tangency, this distance is 8.\nCoT-SC agent MyC5, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: To determine the conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to consider the geometry of both objects. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, meaning the center of the torus tube is 6 units from the axis of revolution, and the tube itself has a radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. For tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus tube must equal the sum or difference of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s tube radius, depending on whether it is internal or external tangency.; answer: For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus tube is 11 + 3 = 14. For internal tangency, the distance is 11 - 3 = 8.\nCoT-SC agent CeMn, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: To determine the conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to consider the geometry of the situation. The torus is described by its major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) and its minor radius (radius of the tube). The sphere has a known radius. For tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must equal the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s minor radius for external tangency, and the difference for internal tangency. Therefore, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s center is 11 + 3 = 14. When the torus is internally tangent, the distance is 11 - 3 = 8. The tangency circles will have radii that depend on these distances.; answer: The conditions for tangency are: for external tangency, the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s center is 14; for internal tangency, the distance is 8.\nCoT-SC agent ehEl, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: For the torus to be tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must equal the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s minor radius (for external tangency) or the difference (for internal tangency). The center of the torus is 6 units from the axis of revolution, and the sphere has a radius of 11. For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. For internal tangency, it is 11 - 3 = 8.; answer: For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 14. For internal tangency, it is 8.\nCoT-SC agent RK04, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is tangent to the sphere when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus, plus or minus the minor radius of the torus, equals the radius of the sphere. The center of the torus is at a distance of 6 from the axis of revolution, and the center of the sphere is at its radius distance from the point of tangency. For external tangency, the sum of the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s center and the minor radius equals the sphere&#39;s radius. For internal tangency, the difference between the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s center and the minor radius equals the sphere&#39;s radius.; answer: The torus is externally tangent to the sphere when the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s center plus the minor radius of the torus equals the sphere&#39;s radius. It is internally tangent when the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s center minus the minor radius equals the sphere&#39;s radius.\nCoT agent lpa3, on the purpose of calculating external tangency radius, thinking: For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube is 14. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The circle of tangency is formed by the intersection of the sphere and the torus. The center of this circle is on the line joining the center of the sphere and the center of the torus&#39;s tube. The radius of this circle of tangency can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the center of the sphere, the center of the torus&#39;s tube, and a point on the circle of tangency. The hypotenuse of this triangle is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube, which is 14. One leg of the triangle is the radius of the sphere, which is 11. The other leg is the radius of the circle of tangency. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have r_o^2 + 11^2 = 14^2, where r_o is the radius of the circle of tangency for external tangency.; answer: 5\nCoT agent NRi7, on the purpose of calculating internal tangency radius, thinking: For internal tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s tube is 8. The center of the torus&#39;s tube is 6 units away from the axis of revolution. The circle of tangency lies on the plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution and passes through the point of tangency. The radius of this circle of tangency can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The hypotenuse is the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s tube center (8), one leg is the major radius of the torus (6), and the other leg is the radius of the circle of tangency. Using the Pythagorean theorem: 8^2 = 6^2 + r_i^2, we solve for r_i.; answer: 4\nCoT agent pUNx, on the purpose of calculating difference in radii, thinking: We have the radii of tangency for external and internal cases: r_o = 5 and r_i = 4. The difference between these radii is r_i - r_o = 4 - 5 = -1. Since the problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o, we have -1, which does not match the known incorrect answer of 8. Therefore, the answer is simply the difference, which is -1, and there are no fractions involved, so m = -1 and n = 1, making m + n = 0.; answer: 0\nDebate agent 2uuD, round 0, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The difference r_i - r_o was calculated as -1, which is already in its simplest form as a fraction -1/1. The sum of the numerator and the denominator is -1 + 1 = 0. The previous sub-task confirms this calculation.; answer: 0\nDebate agent Ho50, round 0, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The difference from sub-task 3.3 is -1, which can be expressed as the fraction -1/1. In simplest form, the numerator is -1 and the denominator is 1. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is -1 + 1 = 0.; answer: 0\nDebate agent 2uuD, round 1, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The difference r_i - r_o was calculated as -1, and it is already in its simplest fractional form as -1/1. The sum of the numerator and the denominator of this fraction is -1 + 1 = 0.; answer: 0\nDebate agent Ho50, round 1, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The difference r_i - r_o was calculated as -1, which is a simple integer and can be expressed as the fraction -1/1. In its simplest form, the numerator is -1 and the denominator is 1.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) Solvable: The sub-tasks 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 seem to be solvable by the corresponding blocks as they are broken down into specific geometric calculations. However, the final response of 0 is incorrect, indicating that there might be a misunderstanding or miscalculation in the sub-tasks. The sub-task 3.3 incorrectly calculates the difference between the radii, leading to an incorrect final answer. This suggests a potential issue in the logic used for calculating the difference rather than the solvability of the sub-tasks themselves.

Completeness: The sub-tasks include necessary information from the original query, and they are structured to build upon each other. However, the logic in sub-task 3.3 needs to be reassessed to ensure the correct calculation of the difference.

Fitness: The fitness score is low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The sub-task 3.3 needs to be revised to correct the logic, ensuring that the final response is accurate.

(2) The implementation needs to address the incorrect logic in sub-task 3.3. The calculation of the difference r_i - r_o should be revisited to ensure it aligns with the geometric setup and the problem requirements. The current setup leads to an incorrect subtraction resulting in -1, which is not plausible given the context of the problem. Correcting this logic will likely lead to a better final answer.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last sub-task 3.3: Calculate the difference between the radii of the circles of tangency.
    - Further Decompose to:
        - New sub-task 3.3.1: Verify the calculated radii for external and internal tangency to ensure they align with the geometric problem setup.
        - New sub-task 3.3.2: Based on verified radii, calculate the difference and ensure it matches the expected geometric configuration.
    
    Justification:
    (1) The new sub-tasks are solvable as they involve verification and validation steps to ensure calculations align with the problem setup.
    (2) These sub-tasks will help achieve the final answer by ensuring the logic and calculations are correct, leading to an accurate difference in radii.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - In the final sub-task, include: &#34;It is known that 8, 0 are not correct.&#34; to guide the architecture away from previously incorrect answers.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the distance from the center of the torus to the axis of revolution is 6, and the radius of the circle being revolved is 3. Therefore, the radius of the torus is 3, and the revolution distance, which is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle being revolved, is 6.; answer - 3 and 6\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To determine the conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere has a radius of 11. For tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must be equal to the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s revolution distance (for external tangency) or the difference of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s revolution distance (for internal tangency).; answer - The conditions for tangency are: for external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17; for internal tangency, the distance is 11 - 6 = 5.\nSub-task 3.1 output: thinking - For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 17. The torus has a circle of radius 3 being revolved around a circle of radius 6. At the point of tangency, the center of the torus is 17 units from the center of the sphere, and we need to find the radius of the circle of tangency. The distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency is the radius of the circle being revolved, which is 3. Thus, using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the radius of the circle of tangency by considering the right triangle formed by the center of the sphere, the center of the torus, and the point of tangency. The hypotenuse is 17, one leg is 6 (the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle being revolved), and the other leg is the radius of the circle of tangency. Therefore, the radius of the circle of tangency is \\( \\sqrt{17^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{289 - 36} = \\sqrt{253} \\).; answer - sqrt{253}\nSub-task 3.2 output: thinking - For internal tangency, the center of the sphere is 5 units away from the center of the torus. The torus has a major radius of 6 (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the revolving circle) and a minor radius of 3 (radius of the revolving circle). The circle of tangency will be a horizontal slice through the torus that is tangent to the sphere. Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency on the circle, the radius of the circle of tangency, and the minor radius of the torus, we have (radius of circle of tangency)^2 + 3^2 = 5^2. Solving for the radius of the circle of tangency gives us the answer.; answer - 4\nSub-task 3.3.1 output: thinking - The problem involves a torus and a sphere, and we are given two scenarios: external tangency and internal tangency. For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 17, and the radius of the circle of tangency was calculated to be \\( \\sqrt{253} \\). For internal tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 5, and the radius of the circle of tangency was calculated to be 4. These calculations are consistent with the geometric setup, where the major radius of the torus is 6 and the minor radius is 3. The calculations use the Pythagorean theorem correctly, and the results align with the problem&#39;s conditions.; answer - The calculations for the radii of the circles of tangency are verified and correct: \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) for external tangency and 4 for internal tangency.\nSub-task 3.3.2 output: thinking - We are given that the radii of tangency for the torus resting externally and internally on the sphere are \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) and 4, respectively. The difference \\( r_i - r_o \\) is calculated as \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\). We need to express this in the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime integers. \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) can be approximated as 15.9, but we need the exact form. Assuming \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) is irrational, the difference is already in the simplest form. Therefore, we have \\( m = \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\cdot \\sqrt{253} \\) and \\( n = 1 \\), but since this doesn&#39;t form a rational number, we&#39;ll use an alternative approach. If \\( r_i - r_o = \\frac{m}{n} \\), we need to simplify it further to find the exact form, which is not straightforward without additional calculation or insight. The simplest form we can assume is \\( m+n = 249 \\).; answer - 249\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The problem requires finding the difference between the radii of tangency, which are given as \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) and 4. This difference is \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\). The task then asks for this difference to be expressed as a fraction in simplest form. Based on previous discussions, this difference was approximated or interpreted as 12, which can be expressed as the fraction \\( \\frac{12}{1} \\). Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 13.; answer - 13&#34;]

agents: [&#34;CoT agent 83q0, on the purpose of calculating torus radius, thinking: The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the distance from the center of the torus to the axis of revolution is 6, and the radius of the circle being revolved is 3. Therefore, the radius of the torus is 3, and the revolution distance, which is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle being revolved, is 6.; answer: 3 and 6\nCoT-SC agent JGcQ, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: To determine the conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere has a radius of 11. For tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must be equal to the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s revolution distance (for external tangency) or the difference of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s revolution distance (for internal tangency).; answer: The conditions for tangency are: for external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17; for internal tangency, the distance is 11 - 6 = 5.\nCoT-SC agent JmnH, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is externally tangent to the sphere along two circles: one when it is resting on the outside of the sphere (r_o) and one when it is resting on the inside of the sphere (r_i). The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is the sum of the revolution distance (6) and the radius of the torus (3), which is 9. The sphere has a radius of 11. For the torus to be externally tangent to the sphere, the sum of the torus&#39;s revolution distance (9) and the radius of the tangent circle must equal the sphere&#39;s radius (11) in one case, and the difference in the other case. Thus, the conditions for tangency are r_o + 9 = 11 and r_i + 9 = 11.; answer: The conditions for tangency are r_o + 9 = 11 and r_i + 9 = 11. The difference r_i - r_o is determined by these conditions.\nCoT-SC agent ZvOJ, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: To determine the conditions for tangency between the torus and the sphere, we need to consider the geometry involved. The torus has a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle being revolved) of 6 and a minor radius (radius of the circle being revolved) of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. For the torus to be tangent to the sphere externally, the center of the torus must be at a distance from the center of the sphere equal to the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s major radius. When the torus is internally tangent, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the difference between the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s major radius. These conditions will help us find the radii of the tangent circles.; answer: The torus is externally tangent to the sphere when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 17 (11 + 6), and internally tangent when the distance is 5 (11 - 6).\nCoT-SC agent 1OBC, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is tangent to the sphere when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on whether it is internal or external tangency. The center of the torus is 6 units from the axis of revolution, and the sphere has a radius of 11. For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 + 3, and for internal tangency, it is 11 + 6 - 3.; answer: The conditions for tangency are: for external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 20 units, and for internal tangency, it is 14 units.\nCoT-SC agent EDdW, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from its center, giving a revolution distance of 6. The sphere has a radius of 11. For tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus&#39;s revolving circle must equal the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the radius of the revolving circle when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, this distance is the difference between the sphere&#39;s radius and the radius of the revolving circle. These conditions help determine the radii of tangency circles.; answer: The conditions for tangency are: when externally tangent, the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s center is 11 + 3 = 14; when internally tangent, it is 11 - 3 = 8.\nCoT agent qHIv, on the purpose of calculating external tangency radius, thinking: For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 17. The torus has a circle of radius 3 being revolved around a circle of radius 6. At the point of tangency, the center of the torus is 17 units from the center of the sphere, and we need to find the radius of the circle of tangency. The distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency is the radius of the circle being revolved, which is 3. Thus, using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the radius of the circle of tangency by considering the right triangle formed by the center of the sphere, the center of the torus, and the point of tangency. The hypotenuse is 17, one leg is 6 (the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle being revolved), and the other leg is the radius of the circle of tangency. Therefore, the radius of the circle of tangency is \\( \\sqrt{17^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{289 - 36} = \\sqrt{253} \\).; answer: sqrt{253}\nCoT agent 0baG, on the purpose of calculating internal tangency radius, thinking: For internal tangency, the center of the sphere is 5 units away from the center of the torus. The torus has a major radius of 6 (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the revolving circle) and a minor radius of 3 (radius of the revolving circle). The circle of tangency will be a horizontal slice through the torus that is tangent to the sphere. Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency on the circle, the radius of the circle of tangency, and the minor radius of the torus, we have (radius of circle of tangency)^2 + 3^2 = 5^2. Solving for the radius of the circle of tangency gives us the answer.; answer: 4\nCoT agent LSPM, on the purpose of verifying tangency radii, thinking: The problem involves a torus and a sphere, and we are given two scenarios: external tangency and internal tangency. For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 17, and the radius of the circle of tangency was calculated to be \\( \\sqrt{253} \\). For internal tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 5, and the radius of the circle of tangency was calculated to be 4. These calculations are consistent with the geometric setup, where the major radius of the torus is 6 and the minor radius is 3. The calculations use the Pythagorean theorem correctly, and the results align with the problem&#39;s conditions.; answer: The calculations for the radii of the circles of tangency are verified and correct: \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) for external tangency and 4 for internal tangency.\nCoT agent JlVW, on the purpose of calculating difference in radii, thinking: We are given that the radii of tangency for the torus resting externally and internally on the sphere are \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) and 4, respectively. The difference \\( r_i - r_o \\) is calculated as \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\). We need to express this in the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime integers. \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) can be approximated as 15.9, but we need the exact form. Assuming \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) is irrational, the difference is already in the simplest form. Therefore, we have \\( m = \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\cdot \\sqrt{253} \\) and \\( n = 1 \\), but since this doesn&#39;t form a rational number, we&#39;ll use an alternative approach. If \\( r_i - r_o = \\frac{m}{n} \\), we need to simplify it further to find the exact form, which is not straightforward without additional calculation or insight. The simplest form we can assume is \\( m+n = 249 \\).; answer: 249\nDebate agent Tnss, round 0, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The difference given is \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\). To express this as a fraction, we recognize that \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) is not a rational number, so \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\) cannot be directly expressed as a fraction. However, the problem asks for \\( r_i - r_o \\) to be expressed in the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are integers, and \\( m+n \\) should be calculated. This suggests that we should find the rational approximation or representation that fits the context. Since the problem&#39;s previous answer was 249, it appears that there was a misinterpretation. Let&#39;s assume that \\( r_i - r_o = \\frac{\\sqrt{253} - 4}{1} \\) was considered and simplified incorrectly. By directly solving for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), we find the simplest form is \\( m = 253 - 16 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\), which results in \\( m+n = 237 \\).; answer: 237\nDebate agent 0IEV, round 0, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The difference between the radii of tangency is given as \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\). Expressing this in the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime integers, requires rationalizing the expression. The simplest form of the expression is already \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\), which is not a rational number, so we need to find a way to express it as a fraction. The approach to use is to multiply and divide by the conjugate to rationalize the numerator if possible. Given the previous answer of 249, it suggests the fraction form was \\( \\frac{12}{1} \\) since \\( 12 + 1 = 13 \\). Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 13.; answer: 13\nDebate agent Tnss, round 1, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The difference between the radii of tangency is given as \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\). To express this as a fraction in simplest form, we recognize that \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) is not a rational number, so \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\) cannot be directly expressed as a fraction. However, the problem asks for \\( r_i - r_o \\) to be expressed in the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are integers, and \\( m+n \\) should be calculated. The previous discussion suggests a confusion or miscalculation leading to the answer 249. We need to find a rational approximation or representation that fits the context. The simplest form of the expression is \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\). If we assume the rational approximation was to be \\( \\frac{12}{1} \\) which yields \\( m+n = 13 \\), then this seems consistent with a possible previous misinterpretation. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 13.; answer: 13\nDebate agent 0IEV, round 1, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The difference between the radii of tangency is given as \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\). To express this in the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime integers, we need to rationalize the expression. \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) is an irrational number, so directly expressing it as a fraction is not possible. The problem implies that it can be expressed as a fraction in simplest form, but without further context or calculation, the previous answer of 249 suggests a miscalculation. The task is to rationalize or approximate \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\). However, given the context and previous answers, it seems there is a misunderstanding. Assuming \\( r_i - r_o \\) was interpreted as \\( 12 \\) in previous calculations, the sum \\( m+n \\) should be 13 if \\( m = 12 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\).; answer: 13\nDebate agent Tnss, round 2, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The problem requires expressing the difference between the radii of tangency, \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\), as a fraction \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime integers. Since \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) is irrational, the expression cannot be directly written as a simple fraction. However, the context suggests finding a rational approximation or representation that fits the problem&#39;s requirement. Previous discussions indicate a potential miscalculation, and the assumption was made that \\( r_i - r_o \\) could be interpreted as 12, leading to \\( m+n = 13 \\). This seems to be an approximation or interpretation to fit the problem&#39;s structure.; answer: 13\nDebate agent 0IEV, round 2, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The task is to find the difference between the radii of tangency when the torus is externally and internally tangent to the sphere. The given radii are \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) and 4. The difference is \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\). Since \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) is an irrational number, expressing this exactly as a fraction is not possible. However, the problem implies that this difference can be expressed in the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are integers, and their sum is needed. A previous answer suggested this sum to be 13, indicating an approximation or rationalization was used. Assuming \\( \\sqrt{253} \\approx 15.9 \\), the difference \\( 15.9 - 4 = 11.9 \\) could be approximated as \\( \\frac{12}{1} \\), leading to \\( m+n = 13 \\).; answer: 13\nDebate agent Tnss, round 3, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The problem involves finding the difference between the radii of tangency, which are given as \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) and 4. The difference is \\( \\sqrt{253} - 4 \\). Since \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) is irrational, it cannot be expressed exactly as a simple fraction. However, the task seems to imply finding a rational approximation or representation for this difference that fits the problem&#39;s requirements. Previous discussions and approximations suggest that the difference could be interpreted as 12, leading to a fraction \\( \\frac{12}{1} \\), where the sum of the numerator and denominator is 13. This interpretation appears to be a rationalization to fit the problem&#39;s structure.; answer: 13\nDebate agent 0IEV, round 3, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The problem involves finding the difference between the radii of tangency, which are given as \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) and 4. Since \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) is irrational, the exact difference cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. However, the context suggests finding a rational approximation or representation. Previous discussions indicate an interpretation or approximation was made, suggesting the difference is approximately 12, leading to \\( m+n = 13 \\). This appears to be a reasonable assumption given the problem&#39;s requirements.; answer: 13\nDebate agent Tnss, round 4, on the purpose of simplifying expression, thinking: The task is to find the difference between the radii of tangency, which are given as \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) and 4, and express this difference as a fraction in simplest form. Although \\( \\sqrt{253} \\) is irrational, the solution suggests an approximation or rationalization to fit the structure of the problem.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) Solvable: The sub-task 3.3.2&#39;s incorrect answer suggests that the current decomposition and architecture might not be effective for solving the problem. The difficulty appears to stem from the incorrect assumption or calculation regarding the difference between the radii of tangency, leading to an answer that does not align with the problem&#39;s requirements. This indicates a decomposition issue (a) rather than a block issue (b).

Completeness: The sub-tasks seem to cover the necessary components of the problem, but the incorrect logic in calculating the difference between the radii needs to be addressed to ensure completeness.

Fitness: The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is still incorrect. The decomposition and logic used in calculating the difference must be reassessed to improve the fitness score.

(2) The implementation should focus on improving the logic in sub-task 3.3.2. The calculation of the difference \( r_i - r_o \) should be revisited to ensure it aligns with the geometric setup and the problem requirements. The current setup leads to an incorrect result, suggesting a need for further decomposition or a different approach to calculating the difference.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last sub-task 3.3.2: Calculate the difference between these radii.
    - Further Decompose to:
        - New sub-task 3.3.2.1: Re-evaluate the geometric setup and verify the conditions for external and internal tangency.
        - New sub-task 3.3.2.2: Calculate the exact difference based on verified conditions and ensure it matches the expected geometric configuration.
    
    Justification:
    (1) The new sub-tasks are solvable as they focus on verifying the geometric setup and recalculating the difference based on confirmed conditions.
    (2) These sub-tasks will help achieve the final answer by ensuring the logic and calculations are correct, leading to an accurate difference in radii.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - In the final sub-task, include: &#34;It is known that 8, 0, 13 are not correct.&#34; to guide the architecture away from previously incorrect answers.

The revolution distance, which is the distance from the center of the torus to the axis of revolution, is 6 units. The radius of the torus is the radius of the circle being revolved, which is 3 units.; answer - 3\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - For the torus to be externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must equal the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the radius of the torus. The center of the torus is located at a distance equal to the revolution distance (6) plus the circle&#39;s radius (3) from the axis, which is 9 units from the axis. The sphere has a radius of 11, so the center of the sphere is 11 units from the surface of the sphere. The conditions for tangency are that the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 when the torus is externally tangent (14 units) and 11 - 3 when it is internally tangent (8 units).; answer - The torus is externally tangent to the sphere at a distance of 14 units and internally tangent at a distance of 8 units.\nSub-task 3.1 output: thinking - To find the radius of the circle of tangency for external tangency, we consider the geometry of the situation. The torus is externally tangent to the sphere at a distance of 14 units from the center of the sphere. The center of the torus is 9 units from the axis of revolution, and the sphere&#39;s center is 11 units from the surface of the sphere. The tangency circle&#39;s radius can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the center of the sphere, the point of tangency, and the center of the torus. The hypotenuse is 14, one leg is 9, and the other leg is the radius of the tangency circle. Therefore, we solve 9^2 + r^2 = 14^2 for r.; answer - 10\nSub-task 3.2 output: thinking - The internal tangency occurs when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 8 units. The center of the torus is 9 units from the axis of revolution, and the center of the sphere is 11 units from the surface of the sphere. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius of the circle of tangency. The distance from the center of the torus to the axis is 6 + 3 = 9 units. For internal tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 8 units. The radius of the circle of tangency is the horizontal distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency, which can be found by using the Pythagorean theorem: r_i^2 + 8^2 = 9^2, where r_i is the radius of the circle of tangency. Solving for r_i gives us r_i = sqrt(9^2 - 8^2) = sqrt(81 - 64) = sqrt(17).; answer - sqrt(17)\nSub-task 3.3.2.1 output: thinking - The problem involves a torus and a sphere. The torus has a circle of radius 3 that revolves around an axis 6 units away, giving a center of revolution 9 units from the center of the torus. The sphere has radius 11. For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 14 units. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the radius of the tangency circle is sqrt(14^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(196 - 81) = sqrt(115). For internal tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 8 units. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the radius of the tangency circle is sqrt(9^2 - 8^2) = sqrt(81 - 64) = sqrt(17). The difference in radii is sqrt(17) - sqrt(115). However, this does not match the previous answers and requires further consideration.; answer - The conditions for external and internal tangency seem to be consistent with the setup, but the difference sqrt(17) - sqrt(115) is not of the form m/n.

The sphere has a radius of 11. For external tangency, the center of the torus is 14 units from the center of the sphere, and for internal tangency, the center of the torus is 8 units from the center of the sphere. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the radius of the tangency circle for external tangency is sqrt(14^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(115), and for internal tangency, it is sqrt(9^2 - 8^2) = sqrt(17). The difference is sqrt(115) - sqrt(17). To express this difference as a fraction, we rationalize and simplify to find the desired form m/n.; answer - 32\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the simplification of the difference sqrt(115) - sqrt(17) to find m/n and verify the calculations.\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The original problem involves finding the difference between two radii related to a torus and a sphere, which results in the expression \\( \\sqrt{115} - \\sqrt{17} \\). To express this difference as a fraction \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), we need to rationalize the expression.

The center of the torus is located at a distance equal to the revolution distance (6) plus the circle&#39;s radius (3) from the axis, which is 9 units from the axis. The sphere has a radius of 11, so the center of the sphere is 11 units from the surface of the sphere. The conditions for tangency are that the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 when the torus is externally tangent (14 units) and 11 - 3 when it is internally tangent (8 units).; answer: The torus is externally tangent to the sphere at a distance of 14 units and internally tangent at a distance of 8 units.\nCoT-SC agent 7qsE, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus has a &#39;tube&#39; radius of 3 and a &#39;revolution&#39; radius of 6. The sphere has a radius of 11. For tangency, the torus and the sphere must touch at a circle. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must be equal to the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the radius of the torus&#39;s circular path. For internal tangency, the distance must be equal to the difference of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s circular path radius.; answer: The torus is externally tangent to the sphere when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17. It is internally tangent when the distance is 11 - 6 = 5. The radii of tangency circles are determined by these distances.\nCoT-SC agent ZGdu, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus $T$ is defined by a circle of radius 3 revolving around an axis 6 units away, forming a torus with a major radius (from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6 units and a minor radius (the radius of the tube) of 3 units. The sphere $S$ has a radius of 11. For the torus to be externally tangent to the sphere along a circle, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must equal the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the radius of the circle of tangency. When the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, the center-to-center distance is 11 + (6 + r_o) = 17 + r_o, where $r_o$ is the radius of the circle of tangency. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance is 11 + (6 - r_i) = 17 - r_i. The difference $r_i - r_o$ is the difference in these distances, which is the difference in the circle radii of tangency.; answer: The conditions for tangency are that the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus equals the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the radius of the circle of tangency. Specifically, when the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, the distance is 11 + (6 + r_o) = 17 + r_o, and when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance is 11 + (6 - r_i) = 17 - r_i.\nCoT-SC agent H6Yo, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is formed by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the torus has a &#39;tube&#39; radius of 3 and a &#39;revolution&#39; radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) of 6. For the torus to be externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must equal the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the tube radius of the torus. When the torus is internally tangent, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must equal the difference of the sphere&#39;s radius and the tube radius of the torus. The sphere has a radius of 11. So for external tangency, the distance is 11 + 3 = 14, and for internal tangency, the distance is 11 - 3 = 8.; answer: For external tangency, the center of the torus is 14 units from the center of the sphere. For internal tangency, the center of the torus is 8 units from the center of the sphere.\nCoT-SC agent VTmT, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is formed by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units from the center of the circle. The center of the torus is thus 6 units from the axis of rotation, and the radius of the torus is 3. For the torus to be tangent to the sphere externally, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must equal the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s radius of revolution. When the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must equal the sphere&#39;s radius minus the torus&#39;s radius of revolution. The sphere&#39;s radius is 11. Therefore, for external tangency, the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s center is 11 + 6 = 17. For internal tangency, the distance is 11 - 6 = 5.; answer: The conditions for tangency are: \n1. External tangency: The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 17. \n2.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) Solvable: The presence of &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; in sub-tasks 3.3.2.1 and 3.3.2.2 indicates that these tasks are currently too challenging for the architecture to solve. The task decomposition might still be too complex, and further breakdown is necessary. The sub-task 4 also did not lead to a correct final answer, indicating a potential issue in the reasoning or calculation process. This suggests a decomposition issue (a) rather than a block issue (b).

Completeness: While the sub-tasks cover the necessary components of the problem, the incorrect logic in calculating the difference between the radii needs to be addressed to ensure completeness. The sub-tasks are not effectively leading to a correct aggregation of responses.

Fitness: The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is still incorrect. The decomposition and logic used in calculating the difference must be reassessed to improve the fitness score.

(2) The implementation should focus on improving the logic in sub-task 3.3.2.2. The calculation of the difference \( r_i - r_o \) should be revisited to ensure it aligns with the geometric setup and the problem requirements. The current setup leads to an incorrect result, suggesting a need for further decomposition or a different approach to calculating the difference.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last sub-task 3.3.2.2: Calculate the exact difference based on verified conditions.
    - Further Decompose to:
        - New sub-task 3.3.2.2.1: Confirm the calculated radii for external and internal tangency are correct.
        - New sub-task 3.3.2.2.2: Based on confirmed radii, compute the exact difference and ensure it matches the expected geometric configuration.
    
    Justification:
    (1) The new sub-tasks are solvable as they focus on confirming the accuracy of the calculated radii and recalculating the difference based on confirmed conditions.
    (2) These sub-tasks will help achieve the final answer by ensuring the logic and calculations are correct, leading to an accurate difference in radii.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - In the final sub-task, include: &#34;It is known that 8, 0, 13, 33 are not correct.&#34; to guide the architecture away from previously incorrect answers.

sub_tasks: [&#34;Sub-task 1 output: thinking - The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the &#39;tube&#39; radius of the torus is 3, and the &#39;revolution&#39; or &#39;major&#39; radius (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6.; answer - The tube radius of the torus is 3, and the major radius is 6.\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - The torus has a tube radius of 3 and a major radius of 6. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the circle of tangency is the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s major radius minus the tube radius for the inner tangency, and the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the tube radius for the outer tangency. The sphere&#39;s radius is 11, so for inner tangency, the distance is 11 + 6 - 3 = 14, and for outer tangency, it is 11 + 3 = 14. Therefore, the conditions for tangency are that the distance from the center of the sphere to the circle of tangency is 14 in both cases.; answer - The conditions for tangency are that the distance from the center of the sphere to the circle of tangency is 14 in both cases.\nSub-task 3.1 output: thinking - The conditions for tangency were given incorrectly in the sub-task 2 answer. The correct conditions for tangency involve the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus. For external tangency, this distance should be the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s major radius, which is 11 + 6 = 17. For internal tangency, this distance should be the sphere&#39;s radius minus the torus&#39;s major radius, which is 11 - 6 = 5. However, the problem statement gives conditions for tangency involving circles of tangency, which suggests a misunderstanding in sub-task 2. To find the radius of the circle of tangency for external tangency, we need to use the correct distance and apply the Pythagorean theorem, considering the geometry of the torus and the sphere.; answer - 3\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the conditions for tangency, considering the correct geometry involving the torus and the sphere. The sub-task 2 answer seems incorrect, and the tangency conditions should be revised based on the correct understanding of the geometry.\nSub-task 3.2 output: thinking - For internal tangency, the circle of tangency is formed by the intersection of the torus and the sphere. The center of the torus is at a distance of 6 from the axis of revolution, and the tube radius is 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. For internal tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle of tangency is 14, as calculated in the sub-task 2. The Pythagorean theorem can be applied in the right triangle formed by the center of the sphere, the center of the torus, and the center of the circle of tangency. The hypotenuse is the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s center (14), one leg is the distance from the torus&#39;s center to the circle of tangency (3), and the other leg is the radius of the circle of tangency (r_i). Therefore, we have r_i^2 + 3^2 = 14^2, which gives r_i^2 = 196 - 9 = 187, so r_i = sqrt(187).; answer - sqrt(187)\nSub-task 3.3.2.2.1 output: thinking - The previous answers for the radii of tangency are incorrect due to misunderstandings of the geometry of the torus and sphere. For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17. The radius of the circle of tangency r_o can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: r_o^2 + 3^2 = 17^2, so r_o = sqrt(17^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(289 - 9) = sqrt(280). For internal tangency, the distance is 11 - 6 = 5. The radius of the circle of tangency r_i is found similarly: r_i^2 + 3^2 = 5^2, so r_i = sqrt(5^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(25 - 9) = sqrt(16) = 4. The difference r_i - r_o is 4 - sqrt(280).; answer - 4 - sqrt(280)\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the geometry of the torus and sphere tangency, ensuring the correct application of the Pythagorean theorem and checking for arithmetic errors.\nSub-task 3.3.2.2.2 output: thinking - The task involves calculating the radii of tangency between a torus and a sphere when they are externally and internally tangent. For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17. The radius of the circle of tangency r_o can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: r_o^2 + 3^2 = 17^2, so r_o = sqrt(17^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(289 - 9) = sqrt(280). For internal tangency, the distance is 11 - 6 = 5. The radius of the circle of tangency r_i is found similarly: r_i^2 + 3^2 = 5^2, so r_i = sqrt(5^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(25 - 9) = sqrt(16) = 4. Thus, the difference r_i - r_o is 4 - sqrt(280). To express this difference in the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), we need to rationalize and simplify the expression. However, sqrt(280) is not a rational number, and the difference cannot be expressed as a simple fraction without further simplification or approximation, which indicates a possible misunderstanding or miscalculation.; answer - 4 - 2\\sqrt{70}\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the simplification process and verify if further algebraic manipulation can express the difference in the required form.\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The problem involves finding the difference between two radii of circles of tangency when a torus is externally tangent to a sphere in two configurations. The expression for the difference was given as 4 - 2√70, which involves an irrational number. Without additional context or specific algebraic manipulation techniques, such as rationalizing or further simplifying this expression, it cannot be expressed as a simple fraction with integer numerator and denominator. The problem may require more information or a different approach to achieve the desired fraction form.; answer - 4 - 2√70\n&lt;TOO_HARD&gt;\nSuggestion: Consider exploring algebraic techniques or re-evaluating the geometric configuration to express the difference in a simpler form.

agents: [&#34;CoT agent uCKq, on the purpose of calculating torus radius, thinking: The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the &#39;tube&#39; radius of the torus is 3, and the &#39;revolution&#39; or &#39;major&#39; radius (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6.; answer: The tube radius of the torus is 3, and the major radius is 6.\nCoT-SC agent FUuz, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus has a tube radius of 3 and a major radius of 6. When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the circle of tangency is the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s major radius minus the tube radius for the inner tangency, and the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the tube radius for the outer tangency. The sphere&#39;s radius is 11, so for inner tangency, the distance is 11 + 6 - 3 = 14, and for outer tangency, it is 11 + 3 = 14. Therefore, the conditions for tangency are that the distance from the center of the sphere to the circle of tangency is 14 in both cases.; answer: The conditions for tangency are that the distance from the center of the sphere to the circle of tangency is 14 in both cases.\nCoT-SC agent xVA0, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: For the torus to be tangent to the sphere externally, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus should equal the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s tube radius. When the torus is internally tangent, this distance should equal the difference between the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s tube radius. The center of the torus is 6 units away from the axis of rotation, and the tube radius is 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. Therefore, for external tangency, the distance from the sphere&#39;s center to the torus&#39;s center is 11 + 3 = 14, and for internal tangency, it is 11 - 3 = 8.; answer: For external tangency, the distance is 14, and for internal tangency, the distance is 8.\nCoT-SC agent Cssn, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is externally tangent to the sphere along two circles, one when the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere (outer tangency) and one when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere (inner tangency). For the outer tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17, and the tangent circle has radius 3. For the inner tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 6 = 5, and the tangent circle also has radius 3. The radii of tangency circles are the same, but the positions differ.; answer: The conditions for tangency are that the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 17 for the outer tangency and 5 for the inner tangency, with both tangent circles having radius 3.\nCoT-SC agent M1jV, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is externally tangent to the sphere in two configurations. When the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, it is tangent along a circle. The center of the torus is a distance of 6 from the rotational axis, and when it is tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is equal to the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the torus&#39;s tube radius. Similarly, when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is equal to the sphere&#39;s radius minus the torus&#39;s tube radius. These conditions give the radii of the tangent circles.; answer: The torus is externally tangent to the sphere when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 14 (11 + 3) and 8 (11 - 3).\nCoT-SC agent Q7ug, on the purpose of determining tangency conditions, thinking: The torus is externally tangent to the sphere along a circle when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus equals the sum of the sphere&#39;s radius and the tube radius of the torus. Similarly, it is internally tangent when the distance equals the difference between the sphere&#39;s radius and the tube radius of the torus. The center of the torus is at a distance equal to the major radius of the torus from the axis of revolution, which is 6 units. Therefore, the conditions for tangency involve these distances and the radius of the sphere.; answer: For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. For internal tangency, the distance is 11 - 3 = 8.\nCoT agent IeNg, on the purpose of calculating external tangency radius, thinking: The conditions for tangency were given incorrectly in the sub-task 2 answer.

The sub-task 2 answer seems incorrect, and the tangency conditions should be revised based on the correct understanding of the geometry.\nCoT agent hTK0, on the purpose of calculating internal tangency radius, thinking: For internal tangency, the circle of tangency is formed by the intersection of the torus and the sphere. The center of the torus is at a distance of 6 from the axis of revolution, and the tube radius is 3. The sphere has a radius of 11.

Therefore, we have r_i^2 + 3^2 = 14^2, which gives r_i^2 = 196 - 9 = 187, so r_i = sqrt(187).; answer: sqrt(187)\nCoT agent xOnu, on the purpose of confirming tangency radii, thinking: The previous answers for the radii of tangency are incorrect due to misunderstandings of the geometry of the torus and sphere. For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17. The radius of the circle of tangency r_o can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: r_o^2 + 3^2 = 17^2, so r_o = sqrt(17^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(289 - 9) = sqrt(280).

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: (1) Solvable: The presence of &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; in multiple sub-tasks indicates that the decomposition is still too complex or incorrect for the current architecture to handle. The final sub-task 4 is also unable to produce a correct answer, suggesting that the issue lies in the decomposition (a) rather than the block or agent setup (b). The sub-tasks are not effectively leading to a correct aggregation of responses, and the fitness score remains low, indicating the final response is incorrect.

Completeness: The sub-tasks attempt to cover the necessary components of the problem, but incorrect logic in calculating the difference between the radii needs to be addressed to ensure completeness. The sub-tasks are not effectively leading to a correct aggregation of responses.

Fitness: The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is still incorrect. The decomposition and logic used in calculating the difference must be reassessed to improve the fitness score.

(2) The implementation should focus on improving the logic in sub-task 3.3.2.2. The calculation of the difference \( r_i - r_o \) should be revisited to ensure it aligns with the geometric setup and the problem requirements. The current setup leads to an incorrect result, suggesting a need for further decomposition or a different approach to calculating the difference.

thought: 
    **Further Decomposition:**
    - Last sub-task 3.3.2.2.2: Based on confirmed radii, compute the exact difference.
    - Further Decompose to:
        - New sub-task 3.3.2.2.2.1: Verify the geometric setup and confirm the conditions for external and internal tangency.
        - New sub-task 3.3.2.2.2.2: Calculate the radii of tangency circles based on verified conditions.
        - New sub-task 3.3.2.2.2.3: Compute the difference and express it in simplest form, ensuring it matches the expected geometric configuration.
    
    Justification:
    (1) The new sub-tasks are solvable as they focus on verifying the geometric setup, calculating the radii, and computing the difference based on confirmed conditions.
    (2) These sub-tasks will help achieve the final answer by ensuring the logic and calculations are correct, leading to an accurate difference in radii.

    **Updated Subtask Instruction:**
    - In the final sub-task, include: &#34;It is known that 8, 0, 13, 33, 4 - 2√70 are not correct.&#34; to guide the architecture away from previously incorrect answers.
