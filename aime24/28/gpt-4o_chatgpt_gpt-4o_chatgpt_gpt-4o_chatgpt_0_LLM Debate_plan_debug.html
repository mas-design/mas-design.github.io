    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### thinking by Debate Agent 3sPl:
The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle, resulting in a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3. The sphere has a radius of 11. For internal tangency, the torus is inside the sphere, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 3 = 8. The radius of the circle of tangency is 8 - 6 = 2. For external tangency, the torus is outside the sphere, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 = 14. The radius of the circle of tangency is 14 - 6 = 8. The difference in the radii of tangency circles is 8 - 2 = 6. This difference can be expressed as a fraction \( \frac{6}{1} \), where 6 and 1 are coprime. Therefore, \( m+n = 6+1 = 7 \).
