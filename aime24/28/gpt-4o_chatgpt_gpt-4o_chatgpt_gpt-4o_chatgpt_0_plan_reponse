        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 (the minor radius) around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the major radius (distance from the center of the hole of the torus to the center of the tube) is 6. The sphere S has a radius of 11. \n\nWhen the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, it can be tangent in two scenarios: when it is resting on the outside of the sphere (r_o) and when it is resting on the inside (r_i). \n\n1. **Externally Tangent on the Outside (r_o):** \n   - The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is the sum of the radius of the sphere and the major radius of the torus, which is 11 + 6 = 17.\n   - The radius of the circle of tangency (r_o) is the distance from the center of the tube of the torus to the point of tangency, which is the minor radius of the torus, 3.\n\n2. **Externally Tangent on the Inside (r_i):**\n   - The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is the difference of the radius of the sphere and the major radius of the torus, which is 11 - 6 = 5.\n   - The radius of the circle of tangency (r_i) is again the minor radius of the torus, 3.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it seems I misunderstood the problem. The radii r_i and r_o are not simply the minor radius of the torus. They are the radii of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere. \n\nLet's correct this: \n\nFor the externally tangent on the outside (r_o):\n- The center of the torus is at a distance of 17 from the center of the sphere.\n- The circle of tangency is at the outer edge of the torus, which means the radius of the circle of tangency is R + r - 11 = 6 + 3 - 11 = -2. This doesn't make sense, as radii cannot be negative, so I must have made a mistake here. Let us reconsider the geometry.\n\nFor the externally tangent on the inside (r_i):\n- The center of the torus is at a distance of 5 from the center of the sphere.\n- The circle of tangency is at the inner edge of the torus, which means the radius of the circle of tangency is 11 - (6 - 3) = 11 - 3 = 8.\n\nI need to correct my previous assumptions. I will calculate the difference based on the correct understanding of the geometry.\n\nWe have two cases:\n\n1. **Externally Tangent on the Outside:**\n   - The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is 17.\n   - The circle of tangency radius is the distance from the center of the tube to the tangent point, which is 17 - 11 = 6.\n\n2. **Externally Tangent on the Inside:**\n   - The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is 5.\n   - The circle of tangency radius is the distance from the center of the tube to the tangent point, which is 11 - 5 = 8.\n\nThe difference r_i - r_o = 8 - 6 = 2.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for m + n where the difference is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms. Here, the difference is 2, which is 2/1, so m = 2 and n = 1. Therefore, m + n = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nAnswer:3",

The radius of the tangent circle is sqrt(17^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(289 - 9) = sqrt(280). For internal tangency, the distance is 11 - 6 = 5. The radius of the tangent circle is sqrt(5^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(25 - 9) = sqrt(16) = 4. The difference r_i - r_o is sqrt(280) - 4.

The rationalization process involves multiplying by the conjugate: (sqrt(70) - 2)(sqrt(70) + 2) = 70 - 4 = 66.

The conditions for tangency are that the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 3 when the torus is externally tangent (14 units) and 11 - 3 when it is internally tangent (8 units).; answer - The torus is externally tangent to the sphere at a distance of 14 units and internally tangent at a distance of 8 units.\nSub-task 3.1 output: thinking - To find the radius of the circle of tangency for external tangency, we consider the geometry of the situation. The torus is externally tangent to the sphere at a distance of 14 units from the center of the sphere. The center of the torus is 9 units from the axis of revolution, and the sphere's center is 11 units from the surface of the sphere.

The center of the torus is 9 units from the axis of revolution, and the center of the sphere is 11 units from the surface of the sphere. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius of the circle of tangency. The distance from the center of the torus to the axis is 6 + 3 = 9 units. For internal tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 8 units. The radius of the circle of tangency is the horizontal distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency, which can be found by using the Pythagorean theorem: r_i^2 + 8^2 = 9^2, where r_i is the radius of the circle of tangency.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, the radius of the tangency circle is sqrt(14^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(196 - 81) = sqrt(115). For internal tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 8 units. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the radius of the tangency circle is sqrt(9^2 - 8^2) = sqrt(81 - 64) = sqrt(17). The difference in radii is sqrt(17) - sqrt(115).

To calculate the radius of the circle of tangency using the Pythagorean theorem, we consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The radius of the circle of tangency can be found by considering the right triangle formed by the center of the sphere, the center of the torus, and the point of tangency. The hypotenuse is the radius of the sphere (11), one leg is the sum of the distance from the axis to the center of the torus (6) and the radius of the torus (3), and the other leg is the radius of the circle of tangency. However, the condition already gives us r_i = 2, which is consistent with the geometry.; answer - 2\nSub-task 3.2 output: thinking - For internal tangency, the sphere is inside the torus. The center of the torus is 6 units from the axis of revolution, and the circle being revolved has a radius of 3, so the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere minus the radius of the torus equals the radius of the sphere. The internal tangency condition is 6 - 3 + r_o = 11, which simplifies to r_o = 11 - (6 - 3) = 11 - 3 = 8.

The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away. The sphere has a radius of 11. For external tangency, the circle of tangency has radius r_i, and for internal tangency, it has radius r_o. For external tangency, the condition is 6 + 3 + r_i = 11, giving r_i = 2. For internal tangency, the condition is 6 - 3 + r_o = 11, giving r_o = 8. The difference r_i - r_o = 2 - 8 = -6, but since we want the positive difference, it's 8 - 2 = 6.

The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from its center. The sphere has a radius of 11. For the torus to be externally tangent to the sphere, the sum of the torus's major radius (6) and minor radius (3) plus the radius of tangency circle r_i must equal the sphere's radius (11). This gives the equation 6 + 3 + r_i = 11, solving for r_i gives r_i = 2. For internal tangency, the major radius minus the minor radius plus the radius of tangency circle r_o must equal the sphere's radius, giving 6 - 3 + r_o = 11, solving for r_o gives r_o = 8. Thus, the radii of tangency circles are r_i = 2 for external tangency and r_o = 8 for internal tangency.; answer - r_i = 2, r_o = 8\nSub-task 3.3.2.2.2.3.2.3 output: thinking - We need to find the difference r_i - r_o where r_i and r_o are the radii of the tangency circles for the torus and sphere. The previous calculations showed r_i = 2 and r_o = 8, but these values do not match the expected geometric configuration as indicated by the known incorrect answers. We should re-evaluate the geometric setup and ensure the correct interpretation of external and internal tangency. For external tangency, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the sum of the sphere's radius and r_i.
