    <pre>Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus T is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 (the minor radius) around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the major radius (distance from the center of the hole of the torus to the center of the tube) is 6. The sphere S has a radius of 11. 

When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, it can be tangent in two scenarios: when it is resting on the outside of the sphere (r_o) and when it is resting on the inside (r_i). 

1. **Externally Tangent on the Outside (r_o):** 
   - The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is the sum of the radius of the sphere and the major radius of the torus, which is 11 + 6 = 17.
   - The radius of the circle of tangency (r_o) is the distance from the center of the tube of the torus to the point of tangency, which is the minor radius of the torus, 3.

2. **Externally Tangent on the Inside (r_i):**
   - The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is the difference of the radius of the sphere and the major radius of the torus, which is 11 - 6 = 5.
   - The radius of the circle of tangency (r_i) is again the minor radius of the torus, 3.

However, upon closer inspection, it seems I misunderstood the problem. The radii r_i and r_o are not simply the minor radius of the torus. They are the radii of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere. 

Let&#39;s correct this: 

For the externally tangent on the outside (r_o):
- The center of the torus is at a distance of 17 from the center of the sphere.
- The circle of tangency is at the outer edge of the torus, which means the radius of the circle of tangency is R + r - 11 = 6 + 3 - 11 = -2. This doesn&#39;t make sense, as radii cannot be negative, so I must have made a mistake here. Let us reconsider the geometry.

For the externally tangent on the inside (r_i):
- The center of the torus is at a distance of 5 from the center of the sphere.
- The circle of tangency is at the inner edge of the torus, which means the radius of the circle of tangency is 11 - (6 - 3) = 11 - 3 = 8.

I need to correct my previous assumptions. I will calculate the difference based on the correct understanding of the geometry.

We have two cases:

1. **Externally Tangent on the Outside:**
   - The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is 17.
   - The circle of tangency radius is the distance from the center of the tube to the tangent point, which is 17 - 11 = 6.

2. **Externally Tangent on the Inside:**
   - The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is 5.
   - The circle of tangency radius is the distance from the center of the tube to the tangent point, which is 11 - 5 = 8.

The difference r_i - r_o = 8 - 6 = 2.

Finally, the problem asks for m + n where the difference is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms. Here, the difference is 2, which is 2/1, so m = 2 and n = 1. Therefore, m + n = 2 + 1 = 3.
