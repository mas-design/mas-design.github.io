    "thinking": "Answer ID 0 correctly follows the process of converting the logarithmic equations to exponential form and solving the system of equations to find the values of \\( \\log_2 x, \\log_2 y, \\log_2 z \\). The calculation for \\( 4\\log_2 x + 3\\log_2 y + 2\\log_2 z \\) is accurate, leading to the correct final answer of \\( \\frac{25}{8} \\) and \\( m+n = 33 \\). \n\nAnswer ID 1 makes an error in solving the system of equations. The calculation for \\( 4a + 3b + 2c \\) is incorrect, resulting in \\( -\\frac{7}{2} \\) instead of the correct \\( \\frac{25}{8} \\). This leads to the incorrect final answer of \\( m+n = 9 \\).\n\nAnswer ID 2 also makes a mistake in solving the system of equations, leading to an incorrect calculation of \\( \\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \\) as \\( -\\frac{13}{3} \\) instead of the correct \\( \\frac{25}{8} \\). The final answer of \\( m+n = 16 \\) is incorrect.\n\nAnswer ID 3 incorrectly calculates \\( 4a + 3b + 2c \\) as \\( \\frac{39}{8} \\), leading to the incorrect final answer of \\( m+n = 47 \\).\n\nAnswer ID 4 incorrectly calculates \\( \\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \\) as \\( \\frac{13}{4} \\), leading to the incorrect final answer of \\( m+n = 17 \\).\n\nAnswer ID 5 does not solve the problem completely and provides an answer of 7, which is incorrect. It does not provide a complete solution to the system of equations or the final calculation required.",
