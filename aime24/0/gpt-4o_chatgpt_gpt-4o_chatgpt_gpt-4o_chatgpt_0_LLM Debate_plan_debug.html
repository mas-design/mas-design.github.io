    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

### thinking by Debate Agent kIoU:
To find the total time it takes Aya to complete her walk and coffee shop visit when walking at s + 1/2 km/h, I need to solve for s and t first. Using the equations 9/s = 4 - t/60 and 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60, I can solve for s and t. Solving these equations gives s = 3 km/h and t = 60 minutes. Then, when Aya walks at 3.5 km/h, the walking time is 9/3.5 hours, which is 2.5714 hours, or approximately 154 minutes. Adding the 60 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is 154 + 60 = 214 minutes.

### thinking by Debate Agent f6JM:
To solve for Aya&#39;s walking speed and the time spent in the coffee shop, we set up the equations: 9/s = 4 - t/60 and 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that s = 3 km/h and t = 60 minutes. When Aya walks at s + 1/2 = 3.5 km/h, the walking time is 9/3.5 hours, which is approximately 2.57 hours or 154.29 minutes. Including the coffee shop time t, the total time is 154 + 60 = 214 minutes.
