    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>First, we need to find Aya&#39;s walking speed $s$ and the time $t$ she spends in the coffee shop. We have two equations:
1. The total time for the walk at speed $s$ is 4 hours, which includes $t$ minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is $(4 - t/60)$ hours, so $9/s = 4 - t/60$.
2. The total time for the walk at speed $s + 2$ is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which includes $t$ minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is $(2 + 24/60 - t/60)$ hours, so $9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60$.

From these equations, solve for $s$ and $t$.

First equation: $9/s = 4 - t/60$. Rearrange to get $t = 240 - 540/s$.

Second equation: $9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60$. Rearrange to get $t = 144 - 540/(s + 2)$.

Set the two expressions for $t$ equal: $240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s + 2)$.

Solve for $s$:
$240 - 144 = 540/s - 540/(s + 2)$
$96 = 540/s - 540/(s + 2)$
$96 = 540((s + 2) - s)/(s(s + 2))$
$96 = 1080/(s(s + 2))$
$s(s + 2) = 1080/96$
$s(s + 2) = 11.25$

Solve the quadratic equation: $s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0$.
Using the quadratic formula: $s = (-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45})/2 = (-2 \pm 7)/2$
Possible solutions for $s$ are $2.5$ and $-4.5$. Since speed cannot be negative, $s = 2.5$.

Now that we have $s = 2.5$, find $t$ using $t = 240 - 540/s = 240 - 540/2.5 = 24$ minutes.

Now, calculate the time when Aya walks at $s + 0.5 = 3$ km/h:
Walking time: $9/3 = 3$ hours.
Total time including coffee shop: $3$ hours + $24$ minutes = $3$ hours and $24$ minutes.
Convert to minutes: $3 \times 60 + 24 = 204$ minutes.
