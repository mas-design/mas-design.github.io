    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>First, we need to determine Aya&#39;s walking speed and the time spent in the coffee shop. We know the total distance is 9 km and for the first scenario, she walks at speed s km/h and the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is 4 - t/60 hours. Therefore, 9/s = 4 - t/60. 

For the second scenario, she walks at speed (s + 2) km/h and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is 2.4 - t/60 hours. Therefore, 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60.

We have two equations:
1. 9/s = 4 - t/60
2. 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

From equation 1: 9/s = 4 - t/60 gives us s = 9/(4 - t/60).

From equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60 gives us s + 2 = 9/(2.4 - t/60).

Substitute s from the first equation into the second:
9/(4 - t/60) + 2 = 9/(2.4 - t/60)

Solve this equation for t:
9/(4 - t/60) + 2 = 9/(2.4 - t/60)
Multiply through by (4 - t/60)(2.4 - t/60):
9(2.4 - t/60) + 2(4 - t/60)(2.4 - t/60) = 9(4 - t/60)
Expand and simplify:
21.6 - 9t/60 + 2(9.6 - 6.4t/60 + t^2/3600) = 36 - 9t/60
21.6 - 9t/60 + 19.2 - 12.8t/60 + 2t^2/3600 = 36 - 9t/60
Combine terms:
40.8 - 21.8t/60 + 2t^2/3600 = 36 - 9t/60
Simplify:
4.8 = 12.8t/60 - 2t^2/3600
Multiply through by 3600 to clear fractions:
17280 = 768t - 2t^2
Rearrange:
2t^2 - 768t + 17280 = 0
Divide by 2:
t^2 - 384t + 8640 = 0
Solve using the quadratic formula:
t = (384 ± √(384^2 - 4*8640))/2
t = (384 ± √(147456 - 34560))/2
t = (384 ± √112896)/2
t = (384 ± 336)/2
Two solutions: t = (384 + 336)/2 = 720/2 = 360, t = (384 - 336)/2 = 48/2 = 24

Since t must be less than 240 (4 hours), t = 24.

Now we know t = 24 minutes.

Substitute t = 24 into the first equation to find s:
9/s = 4 - 24/60
9/s = 4 - 0.4
9/s = 3.6
s = 9/3.6
s = 2.5 km/h

Now, find the time for speed s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h:
Time walking = 9/3 = 3 hours
Total time = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 * 60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.
