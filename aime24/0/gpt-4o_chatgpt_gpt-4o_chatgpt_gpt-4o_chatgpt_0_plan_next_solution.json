        "(1)": "The architecture is still facing issues in solving the sub-tasks effectively. Specifically:\n\n- **Sub-task 1 and 2**: These tasks are straightforward and solvable by the blocks used, as they involve simple calculations of walking time.\n- **Sub-task 3**: The calculation of s and t from the given equations is incorrect, indicating that the block or its configuration might not be optimal for solving simultaneous equations. The equations seem to have been misinterpreted, leading to incorrect values for s and t.\n- **Sub-task 4**: The final calculation of the walk time at s + \\frac{1}{2} km/h is incorrect, as evidenced by the final response and the fitness score.\n\nThe low fitness score indicates that the final response is incorrect, suggesting that the architecture and task decomposition need improvement.",
        "(2)": "To address these issues, we need to further decompose the tasks and adjust the sub-task architecture. Specifically:\n\n- **Sub-task 3**: The calculation of s and t should be revisited with a more reliable method for solving simultaneous equations. The current approach may not be robust enough.\n- **Sub-task 4**: The final calculation needs to incorporate all correct previous results and avoid known incorrect answers.\n\nBy refining the task decomposition and adjusting the architecture, we can aim for a more accurate final answer."
