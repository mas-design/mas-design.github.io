    <pre>Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Please think step by step and then solve the task.</pre>

    <pre>Let&#39;s first determine Aya&#39;s walking speed, s, and the time she spends in the coffee shop, t. We know that the total time for the walk and the coffee shop is 4 hours when she walks at s km/h, and it is 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours) when she walks at s+2 km/h. 

1. When she walks at s km/h, the time spent walking is 9/s hours. The equation is 9/s + t/60 = 4.
2. When she walks at s+2 km/h, the time spent walking is 9/(s+2) hours. The equation is 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.

We have two equations:
- 9/s + t/60 = 4
- 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtract the second equation from the first:
(9/s - 9/(s+2)) = 1.6

Solving this gives:
9(s+2) - 9s = 1.6s(s+2)
18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s
1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0

Dividing by 1.6, we simplify to:
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:
s = (-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45))/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(49))/2 = (-2 ± 7)/2

So, s = 2.5 or s = -4.5. We discard the negative speed, so s = 2.5.

Now, substitute s = 2.5 in the first equation to find t:
9/2.5 + t/60 = 4
3.6 + t/60 = 4
t/60 = 0.4
t = 24 minutes.

Now, calculate the time when Aya walks at s + 0.5 = 3 km/h:
Time spent walking = 9/3 = 3 hours.
Including the coffee shop time, total time = 3 + 24/60 = 3.4 hours = 204 minutes.
