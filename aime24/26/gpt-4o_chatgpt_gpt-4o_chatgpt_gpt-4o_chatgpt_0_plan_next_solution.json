        "Solvable": "The architecture continues to encounter solvability issues, particularly in sub-task 3.2.2, as the final answer remains incorrect. The repeated incorrect answers indicate that the decomposition and block usage are inadequate. The issue appears to be primarily decomposition-related (a), as the task is not broken down enough to be solvable by the existing blocks. Additionally, the incorrect summation in sub-task 3.2.2 suggests that the problem is not being decomposed correctly.",
        "Completeness": "The sub-tasks include the necessary information, but the connections between sub-tasks need to be stronger to ensure that the outputs from previous tasks are effectively used in subsequent tasks. Sub-task 3.2.2 needs clearer instructions to avoid incorrect answers and ensure all necessary steps are followed.",
        "Fitness": "The fitness score remains low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. This highlights the need for improved decomposition and task processing to ensure the final answer is correct. Updating the sub-task instructions to explicitly avoid known incorrect answers could help improve the final response."

        "Further Decomposition": "Last sub-task 3.2.2 -> (further decompose to) new sub-task 3.2.2.1, new sub-task 3.2.2.2. Sub-task 3.2.2.1: Re-evaluate the elements of set A to ensure their individual contributions are correct. Sub-task 3.2.2.2: Sum the elements of set A based on the verified contributions from sub-task 3.2.2.1, while explicitly avoiding known incorrect sums. These new sub-tasks focus on verifying and recalculating the decomposition to ensure accuracy before summing elements. This approach ensures that errors are caught and corrected before final calculations, leading to a more accurate final answer.",
        "Updated Subtask Instruction": "For sub-task 3.2.2.2, the instruction should explicitly state: 'It is known that 49, 19, 55, 25, 34, 32, 60 are not correct.' This will help the sub-architecture avoid these incorrect answers and focus on finding a correct solution."
