    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the set A and the sets B that Bob lists. Bob lists all nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. If A = {a1, a2, ..., an} where a1 &lt; a2 &lt; ... &lt; an, then for each ai in A, the sets B that Bob can list are all nonempty subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai}. The number of nonempty subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai} is 2^ai - 1, since there are 2^ai total subsets and we exclude the empty set. Therefore, the total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum of 2^ai - 1 over all ai in A. We are given that this total is 2024. Therefore, we have the equation sum(2^ai - 1) = 2024. Simplifying, we get sum(2^ai) = 2024 + |A|, where |A| is the number of elements in A. We need to find a set A such that this equation holds and then find the sum of the elements of A.
