    <pre>Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob&#39;s list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

### thinking by Debate Agent XqtB:
To solve the problem, we need to find a set A such that the sum of powers of 2 corresponding to each element in A equals 2024. The number of sets B with maximum element a_i is 2^(a_i - 1). We express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2: 2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^3. This corresponds to elements in A being 11, 10, and 4. Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 11 + 10 + 4.

### thinking by Debate Agent uzyU:
To determine the set A, we need to express the number 2024 as a sum of powers of 2. Each power of 2 corresponds to a maximum element in A. The number of sets B with maximum element a_i is 2^(a_i - 1). Therefore, we express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2: 2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^3. This corresponds to elements in A being 11 (from 2^10), 10 (from 2^9), and 4 (from 2^3). The sum of these elements gives us the sum of the elements in A.

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to determine the set A such that the number of nonempty sets B with maximum element in A is 2024. For each element a_i in A, there are 2^(a_i - 1) such sets. Therefore, 2024 must be expressed as a sum of these powers of 2. The binary representation of 2024 is 11111101000, which corresponds to the powers of 2: 2^10, 2^9, and 2^3. Thus, A = {11, 10, 4}. The sum of the elements in A is 11 + 10 + 4 = 25.
