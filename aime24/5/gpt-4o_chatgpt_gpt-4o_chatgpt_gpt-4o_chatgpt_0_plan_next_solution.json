This suggests that these tasks are too complex and need further decomposition. Suggestions indicate that calculations involving square roots should be simplified or approximated, which has not been effectively addressed in the current decomposition.",

The connection between sub-tasks is not clearly defined, and critical calculations such as the inradius and surface area are not effectively addressed.
