    <pre>Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

    <pre>We have a tetrahedron $ABCD$ with pairs of opposite edges equal: $AB = CD = \sqrt{41}$, $AC = BD = \sqrt{80}$, and $BC = AD = \sqrt{89}$. The point $I$ inside the tetrahedron is the incenter, meaning it is equidistant from all faces. To find the inradius, we use the formula for the inradius $r$ of a tetrahedron: $r = \frac{3V}{S}$, where $V$ is the volume and $S$ is the total surface area.

First, we find the volume $V$ of the tetrahedron. The volume of a tetrahedron with vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ can be determined using the Cayley-Menger determinant. For a tetrahedron with edge lengths $AB = \sqrt{41}$, $AC = \sqrt{80}$, $AD = \sqrt{89}$, $BC = \sqrt{89}$, $BD = \sqrt{80}$, and $CD = \sqrt{41}$, the volume $V$ is given by:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 41 &amp; 80 &amp; 89 \\
1 &amp; 41 &amp; 0 &amp; 89 &amp; 80 \\
1 &amp; 80 &amp; 89 &amp; 0 &amp; 41 \\
1 &amp; 89 &amp; 80 &amp; 41 &amp; 0
\end{vmatrix}.
\]

Calculating this determinant, we find that $V^2 = 144$, so $V = 12$.

Next, we find the total surface area $S$ of the tetrahedron. The areas of the faces can be calculated using Heron&#39;s formula. For the face $ABC$, with side lengths $\sqrt{41}$, $\sqrt{80}$, and $\sqrt{89}$, the semi-perimeter $s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}$. Using Heron&#39;s formula, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})} = 36$.

Similarly, we find the areas of $\triangle ABD$, $\triangle ACD$, and $\triangle BCD$ are also $36$ each.

Thus, the total surface area $S = 4 \times 36 = 144$.

Now, we find the inradius $r = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \times 12}{144} = \frac{1}{4}$.

However, the problem asks for the inradius in the form $\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}$ where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are integers, $m$ and $p$ are coprime, and $n$ is square-free. We have $r = \frac{1}{4}$, which can be written as $\frac{1 \sqrt{1}}{4}$, so $m = 1$, $n = 1$, and $p = 4$.

Therefore, $m + n + p = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6$.
