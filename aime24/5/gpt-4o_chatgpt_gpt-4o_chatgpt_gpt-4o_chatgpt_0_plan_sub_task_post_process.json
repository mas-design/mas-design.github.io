Heron's formula for the area of a triangle with sides a, b, and c is: Area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2). We have three different types of faces in the tetrahedron: triangles with sides (AB, AC, BC), (AB, AD, BD), and (AC, AD, CD). We need to apply Heron's formula to each type of triangle using the given side lengths.; answer - The areas of the triangular faces are: For triangle ABC with sides AB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), BC = sqrt(89), the semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2. The area is sqrt(s * (s - sqrt(41)) * (s - sqrt(80)) * (s - sqrt(89))). For triangle ABD with sides AB = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), the semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(89) + sqrt(80)) / 2.

The volume can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a determinant involving the squares of the edge lengths of the tetrahedron. The formula for the volume V of a tetrahedron given its edge lengths is V^2 = (1/288) * det(C), where C is the Cayley-Menger matrix. The matrix C is a 5x5 matrix where the (i,j) entry for i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 is 0 if i = j, the square of the edge length between vertices i and j if i \u2260 j, and 1 for the last row and column except the bottom-right corner which is 0.
