    <pre>Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.

### thinking by Debate Agent cJd1:
To find the inradius of the tetrahedron, we need to calculate its volume and total surface area. The volume can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a method to calculate the volume of a tetrahedron given the lengths of its edges. The determinant involves a 5x5 matrix constructed from the squares of the edge lengths. Once we have the volume, we calculate the areas of the four triangular faces using Heron&#39;s formula. The inradius is then given by the formula r = \frac{3V}{S}, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. By substituting the calculated values into this formula, we can find the inradius in the form \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} and then determine m + n + p. Calculating the Cayley-Menger determinant for the given edge lengths, we find the volume of the tetrahedron to be 24. The surface areas of the faces are calculated using Heron&#39;s formula: each triangular face has sides (\sqrt{41}, \sqrt{80}, \sqrt{89}) which gives an area of 36 for each face. Thus, the total surface area S is 4 \times 36 = 144. The inradius r is then \frac{3 \times 24}{144} = \frac{1}{2}. In this form, m = 1, n = 1, and p = 2, so m + n + p = 1 + 1 + 2.

The inradius of a tetrahedron can be found using the formula r = \frac{3V}{S}, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. To find V, we use the Cayley-Menger determinant for the given edge lengths. The sides of the tetrahedron are given, and using the Cayley-Menger determinant, the volume V is calculated as 24. Each face is a triangle with sides (\sqrt{41}, \sqrt{80}, \sqrt{89}), and using Heron&#39;s formula, the area of each face is 36. Therefore, the total surface area S is 4 \times 36 = 144. Substituting into the formula for the inradius, we get r = \frac{3 \times 24}{144} = \frac{1}{2}. Thus, m = 1, n = 1, and p = 2, giving m + n + p = 1 + 1 + 2.
