    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find the coordinates of the point C on the segment AB that does not belong to any segment from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). The segment \(\overline{PQ}\) in \(\mathcal{F}\) has endpoints \(P = (x, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, y)\) such that \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). The line segment \(\overline{AB}\) has endpoints \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The line \(\overline{AB}\) can be parametrized as \(C(t) = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)\) for \(t \in [0, 1]\). For a point \(C(t)\) on \(\overline{AB}\) to lie on \(\overline{PQ}\), the coordinates of \(C(t)\) must satisfy \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). Plugging in the coordinates of \(C(t)\), we get \(\left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)^2 = 1\). Simplifying, we get \(\frac{1}{4}(1-t)^2 + \frac{3}{4}t^2 = 1\). Expanding and combining terms, we have \(\frac{1}{4}(1 - 2t + t^2) + \frac{3}{4}t^2 = 1\), which simplifies to \(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2}t + \frac{1}{4}t^2 + \frac{3}{4}t^2 = 1\). Combining like terms gives \(\frac{1}{4} + t^2 - \frac{1}{2}t = 1\). Rearranging, we have \(t^2 - \frac{1}{2}t - \frac{3}{4} = 0\). Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2}\), and \(c = -\frac{3}{4}\), we find \(t = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 2}{2}\). Thus, \(t = \frac{3}{2}\) or \(t = -\frac{1}{2}\). Neither solution is within the interval \([0, 1]\). Therefore, no point \(C(t)\) on \(\overline{AB}\) satisfies the condition for \(\mathcal{F}\) other than the endpoints, except the point \(C\) that lies on \(\overline{AB}\) itself. We need to find \(OC^2\) for a point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) that is not on any other segment in \(\mathcal{F}\). The coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)\). For such a \(C\), the distance \(OC\) is \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)^2}\). However, since no other segment \(\overline{PQ}\) in \(\mathcal{F}\) can pass through \(C\), we need to ensure that \(x^2 + y^2 \neq 1\). The coordinates \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) that satisfies this are \(\left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\), which is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\). The distance \(OC\) is \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{16}} = \frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}\), and \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\) are relatively prime integers. Thus, \(p+q = 1+4 = 5\).
