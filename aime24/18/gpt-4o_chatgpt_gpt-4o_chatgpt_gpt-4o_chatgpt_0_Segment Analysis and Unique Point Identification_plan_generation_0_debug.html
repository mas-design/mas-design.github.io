    <pre># Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Given a set of architectures in the archive and the question. Note that architecture can contain multiple agents, and agnet mean a LLM that use for specifical objectives by specifclaied setting (instruction, tempreture...)

Your objective is to 

(1) Perform task decomposition. Specfically, decompose the give question significantly so that the sub-architecture (or node or block) can perform each of the sub-tasks. The output should be sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n. Do not solve the task for the sub-architecture and do not leak the expected answer in your sub-task description/instruction/question (a short-cut like &#39;output exactly the following...&#39; is also leakage and should be avoided). Instead, decompose the task that easy enough for the sub-architecture to solve. You need to justify how these sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the orginal questions.

Make sure 

(a) Include sub-task ID  and &#39;Based on (task i)&#39; in the instruction of a sub-task. 
For example, 
Similarly, if sub-task 2 requires the output of task 1, then sub-task 2&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 2: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1, ....(origin sub-task 1&#39;s instruction)&#39;

Similarly, if sub-task 3 requires the output of task 1 and 2, then sub-task 3&#39;s instruction should be
&#39;Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and 2, ....(origin sub-task 3&#39;s instruction)&#39;
This helps each sub-task connects to its prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

(b) Each sub-task should be specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question. The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. You need to include details steps (but not the answer) to the sub-task 
For example,
`Sub-task 3: Based on the output of sub-task 1 and 2....`
You can see it clearly states &#39;based on what sub-tasks&#39;

(c) The answer to the last sub-task should be the same as the answer to the final question, so that the architecture successfully solve the complext question by solveing each of the sub-task. 

(2) Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. 
You should structure the architecture as a multi-layered network. Each existing architecture (or blocks) serves as a node, while connections between them act as edges, forming a structured hierarchy of interactions. Additionally, you must determine the number of layers in the network.

For example, if the exising architectures are &#39;COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate&#39; and you determine that there can be 3 layers. There are 3 resulting sub-task from (1) sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 1, sub-task 3:

Example Setup

Resulting sub-tasks:
sub-task 1, sub-task 2, sub-task 3, sub-task 4

Available architectures:
COT, COT_SC, Reflexion, LLM_debate

Network with 3 Layers:

Layer 1: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  
Layer 2: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate   
Layer 3: COT  COT_SC  Reflexion  LLM_debate  

Connection Strategies:

1. Linear Connection: Directly link two block to pass information forward.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) (Single connection and exit)

2. Multi-Layer Connection: An block can appear in multiple layers, forming deeper reasoning structures.
Example: [COT] (address sub-task 1) -&gt; [LLM_debate] (address sub-task 2) -&gt; [COT -&gt; Reflexion] (address sub-task 3) (COT appears in both Layer 1 and Layer 3) (the whole [COT -&gt; Reflexion] is a sub-task architecture that aims to address sub-task 3)

IMPORTANT:

1. Decomposition itself should not be included in the architecture as the question has been decomposed at step (1). Do not assign one block to perform all the sub-tasks (if you put all decomposed sub-tasks into a single instruction for an block, it is very wrong). Instead, assign different block to address each of the sub-task instead.

2. If your previous attemps in Discovered architecture archive are incorrect (fitness value equals to 0), it means the sub-tasks are still too difficult to the corresponidng blocka. Please further decompose the question to easier sub-tasks. 

Your aim is to design an optimal block connection that can performe well on each of the sub-task.Your code should implment the exising blocks given in the archive (the &#39;code&#39; entry of blocks) as it-is without modication: Do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones and only change the connections between the given blocks, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be (&#34;thought&#34;), and it should capture your thought process for and it should capture your thought process for reconnecting the exisitng blocks in achived. 

In the &#34;(thought)&#34; section, include the following:

(1) **Decomposion**: Given the new sub-task from (1). Form your final decomposition, which should include all of the new sub-task. Explain in details how do you decompose the question and how such decomposition is eaiser enough such that the subtask is solavable by the given agent, blocks and architecture 

(2) **Overall Architecture**: 

Given the resulting sub-task 1, sub-task 2, ... sub-task n, design connections between existing blocks to adress each of them. describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the connection design and finally detail the implementation steps. All connection must betweene exising blocks in the archive and no new blocks can be made. The format must strickly follow: 

(a) Use &#39;-&gt;&#39; for connection. for example, &#39;CoT (address sub-task 1) (exisitng block name) -&gt; LLM debate (address sub-task 2) (another exising block name)&#39; means connect the CoT block and the LLM debate block to address sub-task 1 and sub-task 2 correspondingly.

The second key (&#34;name&#34;) corresponds to the name of your block connection architecture. 
Finally, the last key (&#34;code&#34;) corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. You cannot call the exising blocks (e.g., COT, COT-SC) by its name, but must implement them as it is in the achive. If the block is handling a sub-task, add &#39;sub_task=True&#39; when calling the block.

Here is an example of the output format for the new connected block architecture:

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. DON&#39;T try to use some function that doesn&#39;t exisit.
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.


## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use &#34;Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)&#34;. The returned &#34;feedback&#34; from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print(&#39;Generated Answer:&#39;, ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info(&#39;feedback&#39;, &#39;Critic Agent&#39;, thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) &lt; 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return &#39;Error: Feedback info incomplete&#39;
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = &#39;
&#39;.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == &#39;final_answer&#39;:
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info(&#39;answer&#39;, &#39;Final Decision Agent&#39;, &#39;No answer generated.&#39;, 0)
```

5. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer   
```
You MUST return final_answer returned by ```final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)```, instead of answer only.

6. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
```
You MUST add sub_task=True, when handling a sub question made by question decomposition

7. This is WRONG when handling sub-tasks: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;...&#39;
```
You MUST clealy states what sub task it is, it can be solved based on the output of what sub-tasks and what are the steps to solve the sub-tasks


You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_instruction = &#39;Sub-task i: Based on the output of sub-task i and j, ....&#39;
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase([&#39;thinking&#39;, &#39;answer&#39;], &#39;Reasoning Agent&#39;)
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
final_answer = self.make_final_answer(thinking, answer)

# Return only the final answer
return final_answer   
```



# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by reconnecting the exisitng block in archived. Do not try to propose new block or modify the exising block, and only change the connection but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify
Observe the discovered blocka carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the new connection.

Below is the question to solve:

Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

    <pre>thought: 
    **Decomposition:**
    The problem involves finding a unique point C on the segment AB that does not belong to any segment from the family F other than AB itself. To solve this, we decompose the problem into the following sub-tasks:
    
    Sub-task 1: Determine the equation of the line AB and find the parametric representation of any point C on AB.
    Sub-task 2: Determine the constraints for a segment PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis.
    Sub-task 3: Based on the outputs from sub-task 1 and sub-task 2, find the unique point C on AB that satisfies the given condition.
    Sub-task 4: Calculate OC^2 and express it in the form of \(\frac{p}{q}\) where p and q are relatively prime positive integers.
    
    This decomposition ensures that each sub-task is a manageable problem that can be addressed using the existing blocks. The sub-tasks build on each other to achieve the final answer.

    **Overall Architecture:**
    The architecture will involve connecting the existing blocks to address each sub-task sequentially. 
    
    **Implementation:**
    1. Use the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) block to address sub-task 1, allowing the LLM to determine the equation of line AB and represent any point C on AB.
    2. Use the Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought (COT-SC) block to address sub-task 2, since it involves determining constraints with multiple possibilities.
    3. Use the Reflexion block to address sub-task 3, iteratively refining the solution to find the unique point C on AB.
    4. Use the LLM Debate block to address sub-task 4, leveraging multiple perspectives to calculate and verify OC^2 in the required form.
    
    The architecture is designed to leverage the strengths of each block, ensuring a thorough exploration of possible solutions and refining them to achieve the correct final answer.

The slope of the line AB is given by the difference in y-coordinates divided by the difference in x-coordinates: slope = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = -sqrt(3). The equation of the line in point-slope form using point A (1/2, 0) is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, we get y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. This is the equation of line AB. For the parametric representation of any point C on AB, we can introduce a parameter t such that C is a point on AB. Let C(t) = ((1-t)(1/2) + t*0, (1-t)*0 + t*(sqrt(3)/2)). Simplifying, we get C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2). This is the parametric representation of any point C on line AB.; answer - The equation of line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. The parametric representation of any point C on AB is C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2).\nSub-task 2 output: thinking - To determine the constraints for a segment PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, we need to express the points P and Q and use the distance formula. Let P = (x, 0) and Q = (0, y). The distance between P and Q must be 1. By the distance formula, we have sqrt((x - 0)^2 + (0 - y)^2) = 1, which simplifies to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1. Squaring both sides gives x^2 + y^2 = 1. Additionally, since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis in the first quadrant, we have the constraints x &gt;= 0 and y &gt;= 0. Thus, the constraints are x^2 + y^2 = 1 with x &gt;= 0 and y &gt;= 0.; answer - The constraints for a segment PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis are x^2 + y^2 = 1 with x &gt;= 0 and y &gt;= 0.\nSub-task 3 output: thinking - The problem requires finding the unique point C on segment AB that does not belong to any other unit length segment PQ in the first quadrant except for AB itself. We start by using the parametric representation of points on AB: C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2). We then substitute these coordinates into the equation for a unit circle, x^2 + y^2 = 1, to determine when C could be on a unit segment. Solving the resulting quadratic equation ensures that C does not satisfy the unit circle equation except on AB. Calculating OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4, this gives p = 1 and q = 4, so p + q = 5.; answer - 5\nSub-task 4 output: thinking - The task involves calculating OC^2 for a specific point C on the line segment AB.

Let P = (x, 0) and Q = (0, y). The distance between P and Q must be 1. By the distance formula, we have sqrt((x - 0)^2 + (0 - y)^2) = 1, which simplifies to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1. Squaring both sides gives x^2 + y^2 = 1. Additionally, since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis in the first quadrant, we have the constraints x &gt;= 0 and y &gt;= 0. Thus, the constraints are x^2 + y^2 = 1 with x &gt;= 0 and y &gt;= 0.; answer: The constraints for a segment PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis are x^2 + y^2 = 1 with x &gt;= 0 and y &gt;= 0.\nCoT agent bcDt, on the purpose of sub-task 2, thinking: To determine the constraints for a segment PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, we need to consider the coordinates of P and Q. Let P = (x, 0) and Q = (0, y). The distance between P and Q is given by the distance formula: \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1 \\). Since both P and Q must lie in the first quadrant, we have the constraints: \\( x \\geq 0 \\) and \\( y \\geq 0 \\). Additionally, since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, x and y must satisfy the equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). Therefore, the constraints are \\( x \\geq 0 \\), \\( y \\geq 0 \\), and \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\).; answer: The constraints for a segment PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis are: x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0, and x^2 + y^2 = 1.\nCoT agent wjfb, on the purpose of sub-task 2, thinking: A segment PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis can be described by coordinates P = (x, 0) and Q = (0, y). The distance formula gives us the constraint: \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1\\). Squaring both sides, we have \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\). This equation represents the set of all points (x, y) such that the length of the segment PQ is 1. Since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, both x and y must be non-negative, ensuring that the segment lies in the first quadrant. Therefore, the constraints are: \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\), \\(x \\geq 0\\), and \\(y \\geq 0\\).; answer: The constraints for a segment PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis are: \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\), \\(x \\geq 0\\), and \\(y \\geq 0\\).\nCoT agent XGPN, on the purpose of sub-task 2, thinking: The segment PQ must have P on the x-axis, so let P = (x, 0) where 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1. Q must be on the y-axis, so let Q = (0, y) where 0 &lt;= y &lt;= 1. The segment PQ is of unit length, so the distance between P and Q must be 1. By the distance formula, we have sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1, which implies x^2 + y^2 = 1. This is the constraint for the segment PQ to be of unit length.; answer: The constraint for a segment PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis is x^2 + y^2 = 1, where P = (x, 0) and Q = (0, y).\nCoT agent vDRA, on the purpose of sub-task 2, thinking: A segment PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis can be represented as P = (a, 0) and Q = (0, b) where a, b &gt; 0. The distance formula gives the constraint that the length of PQ is 1, so we have sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = 1. Squaring both sides, we get a^2 + b^2 = 1. Additionally, since both P and Q are in the first quadrant, a and b must be positive. Therefore, the constraints for the segment PQ are: a^2 + b^2 = 1, a &gt; 0, and b &gt; 0.; answer: The constraints for a segment PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis are: a^2 + b^2 = 1, a &gt; 0, b &gt; 0, where P = (a, 0) and Q = (0, b).\nCoT agent 28WX, on the purpose of sub-task 3, thinking: To find the unique point C on AB that satisfies the given condition, we need to use the parametric representation of C on AB from sub-task 1 and the constraints on PQ from sub-task 2. C(t) is given by (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2). For C to not belong to any segment PQ other than AB, it means that the coordinates of C must not satisfy the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 except when C is on AB. Substituting C(t) into the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1, we get ((1/2 - t/2)^2 + (t*sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1). Simplifying this equation, we have (1/4 - t/2 + t^2/4) + (3t^2/4) = 1. Simplifying further, we get 1/4 - t/2 + t^2 = 1. Rearranging, we have t^2 - t/2 - 3/4 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we use the quadratic formula t = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)]/(2a) with a = 1, b = -1/2, c = -3/4. The discriminant b^2 - 4ac = 1/4 + 3 = 13/4. So, t = [1/2 ± sqrt(13)/2]/2. These values of t give the points on AB that satisfy x^2 + y^2 = 1. However, we need the point that does not belong to any other segment PQ, which means it must be a point that is not on the unit circle except when it is on AB. Therefore, C is the point where these values of t do not satisfy x^2 + y^2 = 1 except on AB. By checking these values, we find that the unique point C that satisfies the condition is when t = 1/2, which gives C(1/2) = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Calculating OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4. Thus, OC^2 = 1/4, where p = 1 and q = 4, so p + q = 5.; answer: 5\nCritic agent HELC, on the purpose of sub-task 3, feedback: The solution correctly identifies the unique point C on segment AB that does not belong to any other segment PQ except AB itself. The reasoning involves finding the parametric representation of C on AB, substituting into the equation for a unit circle, and solving for the parameter t to ensure C is not on the circle except on AB. The calculations are correct, leading to the conclusion that OC^2 = 1/4, with p = 1 and q = 4, resulting in p + q = 5.; correct: Yes, the solution is correct.\nCoT agent 28WX, on the purpose of sub-task 3, thinking: To find the unique point C on AB that satisfies the condition, we need to ensure that C is the only point on AB that does not belong to any other segment PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. Using the parametric representation of C on AB, C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2), we substitute into the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 to find when C could be on a unit segment. Solving the resulting quadratic equation, we find that the unique point C is at t = 1/2, giving C(1/2) = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). This point is such that OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4, meaning p = 1 and q = 4, thus p + q = 5.; answer: 5\nCritic agent HELC, on the purpose of sub-task 3, feedback: The explanation correctly identifies the unique point C on segment AB that meets the given condition. The point C is found by ensuring it does not belong to any other segment PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. The calculations for the coordinates of C and the value of OC^2 are correct.; correct: Yes, the point C is unique because it is the only point on AB that satisfies the condition of not being part of any other unit length segment PQ in the first quadrant.\nCoT agent 28WX, on the purpose of sub-task 3, thinking: To find the unique point C on segment AB that does not belong to any other segment PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, we use the parametric representation of C on AB, which is C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2). For C to not belong to any segment PQ other than AB, it means that the coordinates of C must not satisfy the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 except when C is on AB. Substituting C(t) into the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1, we get ((1/2 - t/2)^2 + (t*sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1). Simplifying this equation, we have (1/4 - t/2 + t^2/4) + (3t^2/4) = 1. Simplifying further, we get 1/4 - t/2 + t^2 = 1. Rearranging, we have t^2 - t/2 - 3/4 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula t = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)]/(2a) with a = 1, b = -1/2, c = -3/4. The discriminant b^2 - 4ac = 1/4 + 3 = 13/4. So, t = [1/2 ± sqrt(13)/2]/2. These values of t give the points on AB that satisfy x^2 + y^2 = 1. However, we need the point that does not belong to any other segment PQ, which means it must be a point that is not on the unit circle except when it is on AB. By checking these values, we find that the unique point C that satisfies the condition is when t = 1/2, which gives C(1/2) = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Calculating OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4.

The calculation for OC^2 is also correct, leading to the correct values of p and q.; correct: The point C is correctly found to be at (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), and the computation of OC^2 = 1/4 is accurate, leading to p + q = 5.\nCoT agent 28WX, on the purpose of sub-task 3, thinking: The problem involves finding the unique point C on the segment AB that does not belong to any other unit length segment PQ in the first quadrant except for AB itself. We have the parametric representation of points on AB and the equation for unit length segments. By substituting the parametric coordinates of C into the unit circle equation and solving, we find the unique point C that does not satisfy the unit circle equation except on AB.

We start by using the parametric representation of points on AB: C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2). We then substitute these coordinates into the equation for a unit circle, x^2 + y^2 = 1, to determine when C could be on a unit segment. Solving the resulting quadratic equation ensures that C does not satisfy the unit circle equation except on AB. Calculating OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4, this gives p = 1 and q = 4, so p + q = 5.; answer: 5\nDebate agent OkEZ, round 0, on the purpose of sub-task 4, thinking: The problem asks for OC^2, where C is a unique point on AB that satisfies specific conditions. From previous sub-tasks, we determined that the point C on AB is such that it does not belong to any other segment PQ of unit length in the first quadrant except AB itself. The parametric representation of C on AB is given by C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2). Solving for when C(t) does not belong to any other segment gives OC^2 as (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4.

Solving the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 for these coordinates and ensuring no solution exists except when C is on AB helps us find the unique point. The calculation of OC^2 involves finding the coordinates of C and then using the distance formula from O to C. The previous sub-task found OC^2 = 1/4, which is already in the form p/q with p = 1 and q = 4.

Once we determine that C is the point that doesn&#39;t satisfy the unit circle equation except on AB itself, we find OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4.

We checked when C(t) satisfies the unit circle equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 and found that the unique point C on AB does not satisfy this equation unless it is on AB itself. Calculating OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4, which simplifies to the fraction 1/4. Thus, p = 1 and q = 4, which are relatively prime integers.; answer: 5\nDebate agent OkEZ, round 3, on the purpose of sub-task 4, thinking: The task involves finding the point C on line AB such that it does not belong to any other unit length segment PQ in the first quadrant except for AB itself. The parametric representation of points on AB is given as C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2). For this point C, we need to ensure it does not satisfy the unit circle equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 except on AB. Calculating OC^2 involves finding the distance squared from O to C, which is (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4. This fraction is already in simplest form, with p = 1 and q = 4, which are relatively prime.; answer: 5\nDebate agent fPc4, round 3, on the purpose of sub-task 4, thinking: The task is to calculate OC^2 for a unique point C on line AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any other segment PQ of unit length in the first quadrant except for AB itself. From the parametric representation of C on AB, C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2), we use the condition that C does not satisfy the unit circle equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 except on AB. Calculating OC^2 involves finding the distance squared from O to C, which is (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4.

From the parametric representation of points on AB, C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2), we find that OC^2 involves calculating the distance squared from O to C. This is given by OC^2 = (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4. This fraction is in simplest form, where p = 1 and q = 4, and they are relatively prime.; answer: 5\nDebate agent fPc4, round 4, on the purpose of sub-task 4, thinking: To calculate OC^2, we need to determine the coordinates of the unique point C on the line AB that does not belong to any other unit length segment PQ in the first quadrant, except for AB itself. Using the parametric representation of points on AB: C(t) = (1/2 - t/2, t*sqrt(3)/2), we substitute these into the equation of the unit circle x^2 + y^2 = 1 to ensure C does not satisfy this equation except on AB. Calculating OC^2 involves finding the distance squared from the origin O to C, which is (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 1/4. This fraction is already in simplest form, with p = 1 and q = 4, which are relatively prime.; answer: 5\nFinal Decision agent, on the purpose of sub-task 4, thinking: The task involves calculating OC^2 for a specific point C on the line segment AB.

Carefully review the proposed new architectures (&#34;code&#34; entry), the answer of each sub-tasks (&#34;sub_tasks&#34; entry) , the answer of each agnets (&#34;agents&#34; entry), the final response (&#34;final_reponse&#34; entry) and the fitness (&#34;fitness&#34; entry, i.e., the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on the given question), and the &#39;memory&#39; (previous final answer extracted from their reponse and the corresponding fitness score, in the format of a list of dictionary final answer: fitness) in all the history user and assistant answers. Reflect on the following points:&#34;

1. **Solvable**: Assess whether all sub-tasks are solvable by the corresponidng block via checking the output answer of each sub-task. 

- if the answer of the sub-task explicitly contain &lt;TOO_HARD&gt;. This clearly state that task is too hard, what need to be further decomposed. Consider the suggestion given after the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; (you can see the &#39;Suggestions:&#39; next to the &lt;TOO_HARD&gt; )and improve your decomposison accrodingly. See below (a) for what need to be make sure

- If the sub-task answr is incoorect. That means it is not solvable, what need to be improved. It may beuase 

(a) the task is still too difficult for the block, then the sub-task need to be further decomposed. 

When proposing new sub-task, make sure 
(i) it is specific and detailed enough to solve and to help achieve the final answer to the given question.
(ii) all information required to answer the question is proveded by the previous answers or the instruction. 
(iii) the related sub-tasks thinking and answers have correctly input to the current sub-task by adding it to the taskInfo list when calling the agent. 
(iv) The output should be helpful to solve the next sub-task. Also make sure the sub-task connection is clearly by clealy state &#39;Based on the output of sub-task i..&#39; in the sub-task instruction

(b) some agnets in the block is malfunctional or the underlying LLM is too weak to solve the sub-task alone. This can be detemined by checking the agents output to decide whether it works as expected. If this is the case, then we need to get rid of the block and use another block in the architecture. There are then two possibilities
    (i) the agent in the block is not optimal to solve the sub-task, setting needed to be improved (instruction, tempreture...)
    (ii) the agent architecutre in the block is not optimal, a new block that combine exisitng blocks in a different way or different settings need to be proposed
Please jutify it is (a), the decomposition issue or (b) (and (i) or (ii)), the block and agent issue. It could also be both.

2. **Completeness**: Are the sub-tasks include all neccessay information from the irginal query that can ensure the aggregation of sub-task responses can effectively yild a comprehensive answer to the user query? Note that while a sub-task might include only part of the neccessary information, it is not allowable for any particular piece of critical information to be omitted from all sub-tasks. Make sure the sub-task are connected to the prerequisite sub-tasks so that there is enough information to solve it.

3. **Fitness**: Your final goal is to optimize the fitness score after updating the architectures and/or task decomposision based on (1) and (2). The fitness is computed based on the final reponse. If it is low, it indicates that your final answer is incorrect. In your updated architecture or task decomposition, you need to make sure they will update your final response accordingly. 

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should add new entries to the previous answers:

&#34;reflection&#34;: 
(1) Provide your thoughts on the Solvable, Completeness and Fitness of the architecture and/or task decomposision (which sub-tasks are incorrect? which agent in which block are malfunctional?)
(2) identify any inappropriate in the implementation, and suggest improvements (why the improvements can lead to a better final answer? Expain in detail)

&#34;thought&#34;: Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response. 

For case (a), Give the 

(1) **Further Decomposion**: Compre to your previous decomposition attemps in the Discovered architecture archive (see the &#39;thought&#39; entries), how do you futher decompose the questions? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task 1 -&gt; (further decompose to) new sub-task 2, new sub-task 3..., new sub-task n)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new sub-tasks are eaiser than the old one. Do not give answer or short-cut (an example for shot-cut: &#39;output exactly the following:..&#39;, which is not allowed) in the sub-task instruction in any format, but only do the planing. Justify (1) why the new sub-tasks are sovlable and (2) how the sub-tasks can achieve the final answer to the original question.


For case (b), Give the 

(2) **Improved subtask architeture**: Compare to your last block attemps in the history (last answer), which sub-task architecture need to be imrpoved? How do you futher connecting them in a different ways so that the resultsing subtask architeture is able to solve the corresponding sub-task? please give details by the following format: &#39;last sub-task architeture (what architecute was it?) (aims to address sub-task i)-&gt; (improve to) new sub-task architeture (what is the main difference?)&#39; Give detail compare and justify how the new connection is improved than the old one. Note that the new connection still follow the rules that you need need to determine the number of layers as well as the connection, but do not propose new blocks or modify existing ones in the sub-task architecture, and just changes the connection among the block, but block setting like instruction, tempreture are allowed to modify

For case where the final response is not updated and still the same mistaken answer, Give the

(3) **Updated Subtask Instruction**. Read the &#39;memeory&#39; entry, improve the sub-task instruction so that it can know explicitly that some answers should be avoided. For example, you can add `It is known that (wrong answers, include all wrong answers from the &#39;memeory&#39;, i.e., all final answer with 0 fitness score) is not correct` to the last sub-task so that the sub-architecture knows it needs to avoid it.


&#34;name&#34;: Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don&#39;t put words like &#34;new&#34; or &#34;improved&#34; in the name.)

&#34;code&#34;: Update the code entry based on your reflection and thought. Make sure you actually implement all the improvements mentioned in the reflection and thougths and improvement in this code. Make sure only return the final answer, i.e., the output of self.make_final_answer. All the requirement on code still valid: You must write a COMPLETE CODE in &#34;code&#34;: Your code will be part of the entire project (so do not implement any other part), so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets. Do not make any syntactic mistakes. For example. 
if single quote (&#39;) is used in string, then double quote (&#34;) should be used for the whole string.

This is WRONG
`f&#39;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#39;`. 
This is wrong becuse single qupte is used (Maxwell&#39;s) within the sting but single quote is used again for the f-string (f&#39;&#39;). This will casue unterminated string error. To correct it, one should use double quote for f-stirng, i.e., `f&#34;CoT-SC agent ABC, on the purpose of determining changes to Maxwell&#39;s&#34;`

    <pre>reflection: {&#39;Solvable&#39;: &#39;Upon reviewing the sub-tasks and their corresponding agent outputs, it appears that the sub-tasks are not fully solvable by the corresponding blocks. Specifically, Sub-task 3 seems to be problematic as the agents are not consistently finding the unique point C correctly. This indicates a decomposition issue (case a), suggesting that the task is still too difficult for the block. The instructions might not be providing enough detail for the agents to accurately determine the unique point C. Additionally, the final response is incorrect as it repeatedly returns the same mistaken answer, indicating that the architecture needs further refinement.&#39;, &#39;Completeness&#39;: &#39;The sub-tasks seem to include the necessary information from the original query, but the connection between sub-tasks could be clearer. The transition from sub-task 2 to sub-task 3 lacks explicit instructions on how to use the constraints identified in sub-task 2 to find the unique point C.&#39;, &#39;Fitness&#39;: &#39;The fitness score is low, indicating that the final response is incorrect. The final response consistently returns an incorrect answer, suggesting that the task decomposition and/or the sub-task architecture needs improvement to guide the agents towards the correct solution.&#39;}

thought: To address the issues identified, we need to further decompose the problematic sub-task and improve the sub-task architecture. 

**Further Decomposition:**
Last Sub-task 3 -&gt; (further decompose to) New Sub-task 3.1: Determine the range of parameter t for which C(t) lies on AB and verify if it satisfies the unit circle equation. New Sub-task 3.2: Identify the specific value of t that results in a unique point C on AB that does not belong to any other segment PQ.

This decomposition ensures that the sub-tasks are more manageable and provide clear, step-by-step guidance for the agents to find the unique point C. The new sub-tasks are solvable because they break down the problem of finding point C into smaller, more specific tasks that the agents can handle. This will help achieve the final answer by ensuring that the agents correctly identify the unique point C and calculate OC^2 accurately.

**Improved Subtask Architecture:**
Last sub-task architecture (Reflexion for sub-task 3) -&gt; (improve to) New sub-task architecture (Chain-of-Thought followed by Self-Consistency for sub-task 3.1 and 3.2).

This improvement connects the blocks in a way that allows for iterative refinement and consistency checks, ensuring that the agents can accurately identify the unique point C. By using Chain-of-Thought followed by Self-Consistency, the architecture leverages the strengths of both blocks to ensure a thorough exploration of possible solutions and refining them to achieve the correct final answer.

**Updated Subtask Instruction:**
For sub-task 4, add: &#34;It is known that 5 is not correct&#34; based on the memory entry to guide the agents away from incorrect answers.
