    <pre>Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

### thinking by Debate Agent Gcdk:
To find the unique point C on segment AB that does not belong to any segment from the family \( \mathcal{F} \), we parameterize the segment AB. A point C on AB can be expressed as \( C = (1-t)A + tB = \left( \frac{1-t}{2}, \frac{t\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \) for some \( t \) where \( 0 &lt; t &lt; 1 \). Segments in \( \mathcal{F} \) have endpoints \( P = (x, 0) \) and \( Q = (0, y) \) such that the distance \( PQ = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1 \), hence \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). For C to be on some segment PQ, there must exist \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( C = (x, 0) + \lambda(0, y) \) for some \( \lambda \). Equating \( C = (\frac{1-t}{2}, \frac{t\sqrt{3}}{2}) \) with \( P + \lambda Q = (x, \lambda y) \), we get \( x = \frac{1-t}{2} \) and \( \lambda y = \frac{t\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Since \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), we substitute \( x = \frac{1-t}{2} \) into this equation to find \( y \). Solve \( \left(\frac{1-t}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 = 1 \). This gives \( \frac{(1-t)^2}{4} + y^2 = 1 \). Simplify to \( y^2 = 1 - \frac{(1-t)^2}{4} \). Now, equating the two expressions for \( y \) gives \( \lambda^2 \frac{t^2 3}{4} = 1 - \frac{(1-t)^2}{4} \). Solve for \( t \) to find when \( C \) cannot be on any segment other than AB. The unique value of \( t \) that satisfies this condition is \( t = \frac{1}{2} \). Substitute \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) into the parameterization of C to find \( C = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right) \). Calculate \( OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \). Therefore, \( OC^2 = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( p = 1, q = 4 \), thus \( p+q = 5 \).

Substituting these into \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), we have \( \left(\frac{1-t}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{t\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 1 \). Solving, \( \frac{(1-t)^2}{4} + \frac{3t^2}{4} = 1 \). Simplifying, \( (1-t)^2 + 3t^2 = 4 \). This simplifies to \( 4t^2 - 2t - 3 = 0 \). Solving this quadratic equation, we get \( t = \frac{3}{4} \) and \( t = -1 \). Since \( t \in (0, 1) \), we have \( t = \frac{3}{4} \). Substituting \( t = \frac{3}{4} \) into the parameterization of C, we get \( C = \left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \). Calculate \( OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16} \). Therefore, \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \) and \( p = 7, q = 16 \), thus \( p+q = 23 \).
