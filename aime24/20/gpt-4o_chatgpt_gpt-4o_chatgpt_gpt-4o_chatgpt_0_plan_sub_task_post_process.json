        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the conditions for a number to be b-eautiful. A number n is b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, meaning it can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b (0 <= a, c < b), and a is non-zero (since it's the most significant digit). \n Additionally, the sum of these digits must equal the square root of n, i.e., a + c = sqrt(n). \n We need to find the least integer b >= 2 such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. \n First, let's express n in terms of a and c: n = a * b + c. \n The condition a + c = sqrt(n) implies that n = (a + c)^2. \n Thus, we have a * b + c = (a + c)^2. \n Rearranging gives a * b + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2. \n For n to be a two-digit number in base b, we need 0 <= c < b and 1 <= a < b. \n Therefore, n must satisfy 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b. \n Let's iterate over possible values of b to find the smallest b for which there are more than 10 b-eautiful numbers. \n For each b, we iterate over possible values of a and c. \n For each pair (a, c), we calculate n = a * b + c and check if a + c = sqrt(n). \n Let's start with b = 2 and increase until we find a suitable b. \n b = 2: Possible (a, c) pairs are (1, 0), (1, 1). \n These give n = 2, 3.
