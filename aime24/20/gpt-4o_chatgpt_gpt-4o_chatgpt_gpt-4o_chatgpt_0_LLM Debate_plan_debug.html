    <pre>Let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. Call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). For example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). Find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

### thinking by Debate Agent 1BoU:
To find the least integer base b such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers, we need to determine integers n that are perfect squares and can be expressed as two-digit numbers in base b, where the sum of the digits equals the square root of n. For a two-digit number in base b, represented as ab + c, where 0 &lt;= a, c &lt; b and a &gt; 0, we have the conditions: a + c = sqrt(n) and n = (a + c)^2. We will iterate over possible values of a and c for increasing values of b until we find the first base with more than ten b-eautiful integers. Starting from b = 2, we increase b until the condition is satisfied. Through careful examination and calculations, we find that the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers is b = 16.

### thinking by Debate Agent yjc1:
We need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is b-eautiful if it is a two-digit number in base b, meaning it can be written as ab + c with 0 &lt;= a, c &lt; b and a &gt; 0, and if the sum of its digits a + c equals sqrt(n). We need to count such numbers for increasing values of b until we find a base with more than ten b-eautiful numbers.
