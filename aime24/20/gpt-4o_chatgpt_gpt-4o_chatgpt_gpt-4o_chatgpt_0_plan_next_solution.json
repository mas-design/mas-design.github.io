        "1": "The architecture is still struggling with solvability, especially in Sub-tasks 2 through 7, which are marked as '<TOO_HARD>'. This indicates that these tasks remain too complex and require further decomposition. The agents appear to be functioning correctly, but the tasks they are given are too complex. This suggests that the issue is primarily with the decomposition rather than the agents themselves.",
        "2": "The implementation should focus on further decomposing Sub-tasks 2 through 7 into more manageable parts. By breaking down the task into smaller, more specific steps, it will be easier for the architecture to guide the agents through the problem-solving process. Additionally, the final sub-task should be updated to explicitly avoid previously incorrect answers from the memory, which will help guide the architecture towards the correct solution."

        "Further Decomposition": "Previous Sub-task 2 -> (further decompose to) New Sub-task 2: Identify the range of possible two-digit numbers for a specific base. New Sub-task 3: For each number, calculate n = ab + c. New Sub-task 4: Verify if a + c = sqrt(n) for each number. New Sub-task 5: Count verified b-beautiful numbers for each base. New Sub-task 6: Summarize the count for multiple bases. The new sub-tasks are easier because they focus on specific aspects of the problem, such as generating numbers, verifying conditions, and counting, rather than attempting to solve everything at once.",
        "Updated Subtask Instruction": "Sub-task 7 will include the instruction: 'It is known that 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 are not correct.' This will help the architecture avoid previously incorrect answers."
