    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to determine the conditions for a number to be b-eautiful. A number n is b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, meaning it can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b (0 &lt;= a, c &lt; b), and a is non-zero (since it&#39;s the most significant digit). Additionally, the sum of these digits must equal the square root of n, i.e., a + c = sqrt(n). We need to find the least integer b &gt;= 2 such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. 

First, let&#39;s express n in terms of a and c: n = a * b + c.

The condition a + c = sqrt(n) implies that n = (a + c)^2. Thus, we have a * b + c = (a + c)^2.

Rearranging gives a * b + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2.

For n to be a two-digit number in base b, we need 0 &lt;= c &lt; b and 1 &lt;= a &lt; b. Therefore, n must satisfy 1 &lt;= a &lt; b and 0 &lt;= c &lt; b.

Let&#39;s iterate over possible values of b to find the smallest b for which there are more than 10 b-eautiful numbers.

For each b, we iterate over possible values of a and c. For each pair (a, c), we calculate n = a * b + c and check if a + c = sqrt(n). 

Let&#39;s start with b = 2 and increase until we find a suitable b.

b = 2: Possible (a, c) pairs are (1, 0), (1, 1). These give n = 2, 3. Neither satisfies a + c = sqrt(n).

For b = 13, we find that there are several solutions:

1. (1, 8) gives n = 21, sqrt(21) = 5, a + c = 9
2. (2, 6) gives n = 32, sqrt(32) = 6, a + c = 8
3. (3, 4) gives n = 43, sqrt(43) = 6, a + c = 7
4. (4, 2) gives n = 54, sqrt(54) = 7, a + c = 6
5. (5, 0) gives n = 65, sqrt(65) = 8, a + c = 5
6. (6, 3) gives n = 81, sqrt(81) = 9, a + c = 9
7. (7, 1) gives n = 92, sqrt(92) = 9, a + c = 8
8. (8, 0) gives n = 104, sqrt(104) = 10, a + c = 8
9. (9, 2) gives n = 119, sqrt(119) = 10, a + c = 11
10. (10, 1) gives n = 131, sqrt(131) = 11, a + c = 11

Thus, b = 13 has more than 10 b-eautiful numbers.
