We need to do this for each base starting from b = 2 and count how many b-beautiful numbers exist for each base until we find a base with more than ten b-beautiful numbers.; answer: <TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: We should systematically compute for each base starting from b = 2, the number of b-beautiful numbers by iterating over all possible pairs (a, c), calculating n, and checking the condition a + c = sqrt(n). This can be done using a program to automate the checking and counting process for each base.\nCoT agent 3w16, on the purpose of identifying the correct base, thinking: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers.

We need to iterate over each base starting from b = 2, calculate n for each pair (a, c), check if a + c = sqrt(n), and count the number of such n for each base.

For each base, iterate over all possible two-digit numbers, check if they satisfy the b-beautiful condition, and count how many such numbers exist. Stop when you find a base with more than ten b-beautiful numbers. This approach requires computational assistance to efficiently check each case.\nCoT agent Mi80, on the purpose of verifying conditions, thinking: To verify if a number is b-beautiful, we need to check if it is a two-digit number in base b and if the sum of its digits is equal to the square root of the number. For each base b starting from 2, we generate all possible two-digit numbers in that base, which are numbers from b to b^2 - 1. For each number n in this range, we express it in base b to get its digits a and b, then check if a + b equals sqrt(n). This process is repeated until we find a base with more than ten b-beautiful numbers.; answer: <TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Implement a program to iterate over bases starting from b = 2, generate the two-digit numbers for each base, convert them into base b to find their digits, and check if they satisfy the b-beautiful condition. Count the numbers that meet the condition for each base and stop when the count exceeds ten.\nCoT agent nPym, on the purpose of counting numbers, thinking: To solve the problem, we need to iterate over integer bases starting from b = 2, and for each base, we need to consider all two-digit numbers in that base, which range from b to b^2 - 1. For each number n in this range, we convert it into base b to obtain its digits and check if the sum of the digits equals the square root of n. We count how many such numbers exist for each base. The task is computationally intensive but feasible, as it involves iterating over numbers and checking conditions based on their base-b representations. This task can be automated using a program to efficiently count the numbers that meet the b-beautiful condition for each base.; answer: <TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Implement a program that iterates over bases starting from b = 2, generates the two-digit numbers for each base, converts them into base b to find their digits, and checks if they satisfy the b-beautiful condition. Count the numbers that meet the condition for each base and stop when the count exceeds ten.\nCoT agent hX6Y, on the purpose of verifying counts, thinking: To verify the count of b-beautiful integers for accuracy, we need to ensure that the program correctly iterates over bases starting from b = 2, generates all two-digit numbers in each base, converts them into base b to obtain their digits, and checks if the sum of the digits equals the square root of the number. The count should be verified by checking the logic of the program and possibly comparing it with manual calculations or a simpler case. However, without the actual output from sub-task 5 or a program to verify, it is difficult to ensure the count's accuracy directly.; answer: <TOO_HARD>\nSuggestion: Implement a program to verify the counts by iterating over bases, generating two-digit numbers, converting them to base b, and checking the b-beautiful condition. Compare the results with expected values for smaller bases to ensure accuracy.\nCoT agent AexQ, on the purpose of identifying the correct base, thinking: The problem involves finding the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-beautiful integers. A b-beautiful integer is defined as a two-digit number in base b where the sum of its digits equals the square root of the integer. The bases 13 to 20 have been checked and found not to satisfy the condition. Therefore, we need to check bases larger than 20. Each base b will have two-digit numbers from b to b^2 - 1. For each number, convert it to base b, sum the digits, and check if it equals the square root of the number. This process needs to be done for each base until more than ten b-beautiful numbers are found.; answer: 21"

A b-beautiful number is one that has two digits in base b and the sum of these digits equals the square root of the number. For a number to have two digits in base b, it must be between b and b^2 - 1. We need to check each base starting from b = 2 and count how many numbers satisfy the b-beautiful condition for each base.
