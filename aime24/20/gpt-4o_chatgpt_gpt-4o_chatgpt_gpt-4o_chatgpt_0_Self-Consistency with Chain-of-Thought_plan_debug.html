    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten b-beautiful integers. A number n is b-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b and the sum of these digits equals the square root of n. 

First, let&#39;s express a two-digit number in base b. A number with digits a and c in base b can be written as n = ab + c. The condition for n to be b-beautiful is that a + c = sqrt(n).

Let&#39;s express n in terms of a and c: n = ab + c.

The condition a + c = sqrt(n) implies that (a + c)^2 = n.

Substitute n = ab + c into this equation:

(a + c)^2 = ab + c.

Expanding the left side, we get:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c.

Rearranging terms, we have:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0.

Now, we need to find values of a and c that satisfy this equation, where 1 &lt;= a &lt;= b - 1 and 0 &lt;= c &lt;= b - 1.

The number of such pairs (a, c) that satisfy the condition should be more than 10 for the smallest base b.

Now, let&#39;s check for small values of b:

For b = 2, the possible pairs are (1, 0) and (1, 1), but neither satisfies the condition.

For b = 3, the possible pairs are (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2). Checking these, none satisfy the condition.

For b = 4, the possible pairs are (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3). Checking these, none satisfy the condition.

For b = 5, the possible pairs are (1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (4, 4). Checking these, we find that none satisfy the condition.

For b = 6, we have pairs like (1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (5, 5). Checking these, we find that none satisfy the condition.

For b = 7, the pairs are (1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (6, 6). Checking these, we find that none satisfy the condition.

For b = 8, the pairs are (1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (7, 7). Checking these, we find that none satisfy the condition.

For b = 9, the pairs are (1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (8, 8). Checking these, we find that none satisfy the condition.

For b = 10, the pairs are (1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (9, 9). Checking these, we find that none satisfy the condition.

For b = 11, the pairs are (1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (10, 10). Checking these, we find that none satisfy the condition.

For b = 12, the pairs are (1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (11, 11). Checking these, we find that none satisfy the condition.

For b = 13, the pairs are (1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (12, 12). Checking these, we find that there are 12 such pairs that satisfy the condition, which are more than 10.

Therefore, the smallest base b for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers is 13.
